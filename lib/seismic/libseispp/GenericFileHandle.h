/* \brief Generic file handle for seismic data stored with fixed length headers.

   Much multichannel processing was born from the concept of linear file 
   formats born of tape processing.  This model remains useful for 
   many types of data processing.  This object attempts to standardize 
   reading and writing of data into such file formats with the only 
   restriction being that the data have to have header data stored in 
   a fixed length structure.  The header structure itself is defined in 
   the writer by constructors and is considered absolutely immutable.

    public:
        /*! Primary constructor. 

          This is expected to be the only constructor for this 
          handle object.  It opens a requested file in either read
          or write mode.  Reads and write cannot be mixed on the
          same handle.  

          \param filename is the data file to be read or created.
          \param tracetype is a unique data type identifier used 
            internally to define format (implementation dependent)
          \param namemap is an object that provides a cross referencing
            between the internal and external namespace.
          \param orderkeys is a list of attributes used to define
            internal groupings during reads.  Ignored in writing 
            so writers can leave this empty. 
          \param ensmdlist is a list of internal names to be loaded
            as global for the entire ensemble.  These are extracted
            for input and pushed to all headers in output.  
          \param tmdlist is a list of internal names for metadata to
            be loaded for every object read or to be stored for
            each object written.
          \param read_only is true if as name implies this is to
            be used only in read mode. 
          \param ns_key is a Metadata tag (internal name, not external
            name for given file format) for number of samples.
          \param dt_key is a Metadata tag (internal name, not external)
            used to define sample interval in seconds. 
          \param dtscl is a scale factor to be applied to the external
            files stored sample rate.  This is necessary, for example,
            with segy/su files where dt is defined in microseconds. 
          \param using_sample_interval is used as a flag to define
            the physical meaning of the dt_key parameter.  When 
            this parameter is true it is assumed the dt_key attribute
            is the sample interval.  When false it is assumed the
            value stored is sampling frequency = 1/dt.  (default true)
          \param nowritedead defines how to handle traces maked dead.
            When true (the default) traces marked dead (live=false)
            are ignored.  When false a zero pad version will be inserted.
            The later, for example, is used by segy.
          \exception A SeisppError can be thrown for a number of reasons.
            There are the obvious ones of open failure, but a more 
            subtle issue needs to be recognized.  The following must
            be defined in the required metadata list or the constructor
            will throw an excpetion:  nsamp and dt.

          master copy in a boost::shared_pointer or manage the 
          destruction of the object yourself.  The problem is that
