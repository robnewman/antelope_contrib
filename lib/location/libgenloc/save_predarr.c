/* ema is much harder to compute because of the decision to allow
variable surface velocities at each station.  The analytic result
is simple:  p = sin(theta)/v -- Snell's law with p = magnitude of
the computed slowness vector.  The complexity is in the db lookup
scheme and making the routine bombproof.  The lookup uses dbmatches.
When a lookup fails we revert to a default making a guess for P 
or S based on the phase name.  We do this fairly intelligently 
by searching backward from the end of the phase name for the first
occurence of P or S.  This should work correctly for any phase
I can think of except Lg.  I handle it specially for that reason.

This routine assumes that we have already verified that db has
the stavel table defined.  If it is empty all the matches fail, but
it should still function.  Otherwise bad things will happen. 

Normal return is a nonegative angle of the computed emergence angle
in degrees.  A negative angle should be trapped as an error as the
result is meaningless.

/* This function computes the attributes of the predarr table.  
This is seriously complicated by the fact that the timedef and 
slowdef attributes in the css3.0 schema allow independently turning
off time and slowness residuals.  The way we solve this here is to
first save results for all the entries in the Arrival tbl keeping
a temporary list of all the arid values found in the Arrival tbl.  
We then use a stupid linear search algorithm against each arid found
in the Slowness_vector table and only compute a new predarr row if
the arid found for that Slowness vector did not match any found in arid.
The linear search is acceptable here under an assumption that arrival
data will outnumber slowness vector measurements in most locations. 

This algorithm looks for the stavel table that is also defined in the
takeoff schema extensions.  This table defines surface velocities to 
use in computing emergence angles (ema).  If an entry is not found
for a given phase in stavel, the program tries to decide if this is a
P or S phase (by looking at the last character in the phase name) and 
using a default (hardwired below).  This will generate a complain error
because the values in predarr are not necessarily consistent with vmodel
in this situation.

arguments:
	db - database to save results to
	atbl - Tbl of Arrival structures used in genloc
	utbl - Tbl of Slowness_vector structures comparable to a
	h - hypocenter estimate to be used to compute predarr rows
	orid - orid database id assigned to this solution.
	vmodel - name of velocity model being used (key of stavel)

Returns 0 for success, anything else indicates and error.  A positive
return indicates the number of warning messages issued.  A negative
return indicates nothing was written because the predarr table could
not be written due to either:  (1) undefined in the schema or (2) 
table is not writeable.
