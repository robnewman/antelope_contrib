.SH NAME
db_xvimage\- display databased images in xv
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
db_xvimage db
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a DEPRECATED interface. It has been replaced by 
db_extfile_proc(1).

db_xvimage takes an input database view and displays the image 
files referenced by dir/dfile with the program xv. db_xvimage 
is meant to be run from the .dbe.pf parameter file.

db_xvimage checks to see if a reasonable number of files 
has been selected. For large requests, a graphical dialog
box is presented first for confirmation.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The number of files considered to be a 'large request' is 
currently set to 25, and not configurable without modifying 
the script. The point of this trap is really to avoid bringing
down the window manager by requesting thousands of display 
windows. Thus, not much configuration should be needed.
