.TH ACRO 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
acro \- interact with acronym database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
acro [-d] [-f] [-n] [-g] [-e] [-c] [-o] [acronym | expression]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The acro program interacts with a database of acronyms and their 
expansions. If the acronym specified on the command line is found in the database, 
it is returned (including multiple interpretations if present). Any 
context or comment fields are appended in parentheses. 
If the acronym is not found, the user is prompted for an interpretation. If 
none is given, the program quits. Otherwise the listed interpretation is 
added to the database. In addition to being prompted for an interpretation
(i.e. an expansion of the acronym), the user is prompted for the context 
of the acronym as well as a comment. These may be left blank by hitting
the Enter key, defaulting the values to NULL. 

The -g option may be used for grep-style searches. If the expression is 
enclosed in forward slashes, the argument is treated as a regular expression 
to be applied to the table. If there are no forward slashes, the argument 
is wrapped as /.*expression.*/ and then used as a regular expression to 
search the table. If the expression is wrapped in forward slashes, the 
expression must be matched exactly.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -d 
Launch dbe(1) with edit permissions (if possible) on the acronyms database

.IP -f
force addition of acronym (useful to give an alternate interpretation)

.IP -g
interpret the argument as a regular-expression for matching acronyms. 
If the argument is delimited by '/' characters, an exact match to the 
specified expression is required. Otherwise, the search lists all arguments
for which the acronym contains the string given in the argument. 

.IP -e 
Same as -g except the regular expression is applied to the expansion 
field rather than the acronym field. 

.IP -c
Same as -g except the regular expression is applied to the context
field rather than the acronym field. 

.IP -o
Same as -g except the regular expression is applied to the comment
field rather than the acronym field. 

.IP -n
return the number of acronyms in the database
.SH FILES
The database pointed to by the parameter file (see below) must be 
in Acronyms1.2 format.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
