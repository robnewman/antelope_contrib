.TH MAKE_CONTRIB_SRCDISTRO 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
make_contrib_srcdistro \- Package Antelope contributed-code for export
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
make_contrib_srcdistro [-r readme_file] [-t tag] [-c ftpdir]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
make_contrib_srcdistro uses the cvs(1) export command to check-out a 
distribution of the Antelope contributed source code for distribution.
make_contrib_srcdistro then wraps the resulting directory into a 
compressed tar file that is intended to be unpacked from the 
directory $ANTELOPE. Unless the -c option is specified, the resulting compressed 
tar file is left in the directory from which make_contrib_srcdistro is run.

As recommended from the CVS documentation, the export distribution 
is tagged with the date of formation, such that it can be regenerated 
if necessary. make_contrib_srcdistro names the output tar file 
according to this timestamp. The exact filename of the tar file is set
by the tarfile parameter in the parameter file, which is a string interpretable 
by the epoch2str(3) command. If this file will be updated frequently, 
it may be advisable to leave out time information entirely and replace 
it with a suffix such as "_latest".

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-r readme_file"
Takes the README file from the specified path instead of the 
standard location. Normally this option should not be necessary.  

.IP "-c ftpdir"
This option allows make_contrib_srcdistro to be run from a cron-job, maintaining 
up-to-date copies of the source code in a directory specified by ftpdir. 

.IP "-t tag"
Ignore all date-specific checkouts and file-naming. Instead, build a tarball that 
is checked out with the specified CVS tag (such as the tag used to mark the 
repository at the time of each official Antelope software release). 

.SH FILES
$(ANTELOPE)/data/misc/README.contrib  contains the readme file for the tar distribution

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The timestamp is currently in UTC timezone, whereas CVS 
is probably using local time, thus the timestamp is approximate.

The -t option may not be compatible with all the other options.
