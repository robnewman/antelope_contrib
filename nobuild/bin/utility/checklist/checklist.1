.TH CHECKLIST 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
checklist \- standardized program to implement custom GUI checklists
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBchecklist\fP \fItemplate\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The checklist program presents an ordered set of buttons in a graphical 
user interface, allowing users to methodically step through lists of 
sequential to-do items specified in the parameter file. The contents and 
actions of the checklist items are configured in the checklist.pf file. 
There may be several different types of checklists configured in a given parameter file, 
each with its own items. See the example shown below for one such template. 

In the simplest case, the checklist program merely keeps track of what you have 
done in an ordered list of tasks to accomplish. The more advanced usage is to let 
some or all of the to-do list buttons launch commands that perform or help 
perform individual tasks. Therefore in addition to the name of the checklist step, 
each checklist item may have an optional \fIcommand\fP which will be executed
when the button is chosen. Buttons with configured, non-empty commands 
will turn green on mouse-over; buttons that do not launch commands will 
turn yellow. These colors may be overridden in the parameter file with 
the commandcolor and nocommandcolor parameters (which can also be left blank
for no coloring). 

Each checklist item has three states: untouched, finished, and intentionally skipped. 
The first is indicated by an unchecked-checkbox (at left of each item) and an 
active, readable button for the item. The second state is indicated by a 
checked-off checkbox and a grayed out button. The third state is indicated by 
a checked-off checkbox and a still-active button. Tasks that are in the finished 
state may be brought back to the untouched state by de-activating the checkbox. 
Tasks that are in the intentionally-skipped state may be followed through upon
(launched, or marked as completed) by clicking on the still-active button.

An optional description parameter may be given alongside each step (as
shown in the parameter file below). This will be shown in a balloon-help
window if the mouse dwells on a given button for too long, and if the 
use_balloons parameter is set to 1. 

A Cntl-r or Cntl-R in the checklist window will reset all buttons to their 
initial state (likewise this can be done with the File->Reset menu item). 
A Cntl-c or Cntl-C in the checklist window will quit the application (or
one can use File->Quit).

This still needs a -p option. Multiline TCL code 
snippets in the parameter-file \fIcommand\fP entries have not yet been tested.
A feature to check completeness upon exit exists in other programs and needs 
to be transferred here. 

No checking is done to see if a launched command fails. 

There should be an optional interlock to prevent later steps from 
being executed unless earlier steps are done or intentionally skipped.
