.TH DB_EXTFILE_PROC 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
db_extfile_proc \- Run arbitrary commands on Datascope extfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
db_extfile_proc -m mode [-u] [-w nmax] [-t table] dbtable
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
db_extfile_proc takes an input database view and runs commands on the
files referenced by dir/dfile with arbitrary programs. 
db_extfile_proc is meant to be run from the .dbe.pf parameter file, 
although it can take any table name from the command line as long as 
that table has dir/dfile references. A common use is to run the 
image-display program xv(1) on a set of files containing images. This is 
useful if the user wishes to pass in a view via standard-input, in 
which case the dbtable argument should be given as "-".  With the -t option,
the base table from which to take dir and dfile may be specified (useful 
if the input table is a view with multiple dir/dfile fields).

The mode specified in the command line identifies a set of commands 
from the parameter file. These commands may include the macro values 
"EXTFILE",  "EXTFILES", and "EXTFILES_#", where # is an integer between 
1 and 9. The EXTFILES is replaced by a list of all external 
files in the view. The EXTFILE macro triggers a loop around the block of 
commands. In this case the block of commands is executed once for each 
specified external file, with EXTFILE being replaced by the filename. 
Both EXTFILE and EXTFILES may be used at once, in which case the 
file-list substitution is performed before the iterative loop over each file.
The EXTFILE_[1-9] macros are replaced with the corresponding file names 
in the order in which they show up in the view. This is useful for such 
things as row comparison and combined processing.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-m mode"
Specifies the block of commands to be used from the parameter file.
Required.

.IP "-t table"
Specify the name of the table from which extfile() dir and dfile entries 
are taken.

.IP "-w nmax"
Specifies the maximum number of files to accept without requiring 
confirmation from the user. This is intended to prevent swamping the window
manager or CPU with requests to display or otherwise process thousands 
of files.

.IP -u 
If this is specified, the field "url" is extracted from the table instead
of the dir/dfile combination constructed by extfile().

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This is intended to replace db_xvimage(1), which is deprecated.

Since this is assumed to have been launched from dbe, no checking 
is done to see that the input view or table is valid and contains 
one or more files. 

The EXTFILE_# mechanism only works for files from 1-9. If higher 
numbers are specified, the behaviour of the entire program may be 
unspecified. 

db_extfile_proc currently wraps each command in a perl system() 
command. A '-e' option could be added to trigger direct eval() of
the listed commands, allowing more general perl processing.
