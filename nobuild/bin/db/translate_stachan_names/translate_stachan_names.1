.TH TRANSLATE_STACHAN_NAMES 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
translate_stachan_names \- look for stations not in translation database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
translate_stachan_names [-v] [-n] translation_db dbname [dbname...]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
translate_stachan_names replaces old station-names with new ones in the
specified database, based on the entries in the translation_db database. If 
the verbose option or the -n option is specified, a report is produced on the 
translation decisions.

The database of station-name translations maps old station names, where
the channel and/or gain band are sometimes coded into the station-name itself, 
into CSS3.0-style station and channel codes. For example, "CRPN" translates to 
"CRP SHN". 

Here is the cascade of translation decisions:

1) If there is a non-null entry for 'newchan' in the translation database, 
use it regardless of what the target database says.

2) Otherwise: If there is a non-null entry for 'chan' in the target database,
and that value shows up in the parameter file of channel-name translations,
use the specified translation value from the parameter file. 

3) Otherwise: If there is a non-null entry for 'chan' in the target database, 
preserve it.

4) Otherwise: Use the value specified for 'defaultchan' in the translation 
database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
It is critical to resolve all omissions in the translation database before 
running this script, since in general the translation may not be run twice.
Problems would occur, for example, if RDTN becomes RDT:SHN on the first run,
then the new RDT becomes RDT:SHZ on the second run. Thus, the
tabulate_missed_stations script must be run first to identify all omissions 
from the translation database, and the translation database must be updated.
