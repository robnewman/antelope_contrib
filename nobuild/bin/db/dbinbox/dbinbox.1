.TH DBINBOX 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
dbinbox \- summarize a mail file in a database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbinbox [-v] [-1] mail_file dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mail files, especially in-boxes, can sometimes grow to unfortunately 
large sizes, leaving unhandled emails (and therefore the issues and 
people connected to them) hanging indefinitely in hope of response. The 
dbinbox utility is intended to help audit this problem, by creating 
summary statistics on a given mailbox. For example, by aiming the 
utility at a user's raw inbox file, one can create a table with the 
senders' email addresses, the number of messages from each sender, and the 
dates and times of the oldest and newest messages from that sender. 
This summary is saved in the \fIsummary\fP table of a database 
in Mail1.2 schema. Seen in this summarized form, unacceptable omissions 
and delays in responding can often be spotted more readily. 

dbinbox erases the summary table of the mail database before each run. 
This allows the table to be easily refreshed, which will be necessary frequently
for something that changes as often as an email inbox. One option is 
to run dbinbox out of the cron utility, keeping an inbox summary that 
is pretty much up-to-date.

Once the database summary is created and maintained, other options 
become available such as monitoring the database with PHP web-scripts etc.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Some email agents allow you to move an email message out of the inbox and into some other 
folder, but they don't alter the physical files until later on. For example, in the Netscape 7.0
mail reader, one must choose File->Compact Folders in order to finalize changes to the inbox. 
The dbinbox utility reflects the actual contents of the inbox file, regardless of any 
tags inserted by the mail reading application, thus the output of dbinbox and the view seen 
in the mail reader may not always be in perfect sync.
