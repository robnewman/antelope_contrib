.SH NAME
dbassoc_arrival_fold \- run dbassoc_arrival and fold the assocs into hypocenter database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbassoc_arrival_fold [-p pdelta] [-s sdelta] arrival_db origin_db
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbassoc_arrival_fold is a wrapper around dbassoc_arrival(1). For details on the 
command-line arguments, see dbassoc_arrival(1). This program runs dbassoc_arrival, 
then folds the resulting associations back into the origin_db database. What this 
means is that every arrival in arrival_db that associates with an origin_db hypocenter 
will be copied into origin_db.arrival, with the arid reset appropriately. An assoc 
row will also be added to origin_db.assoc. Finally, the 'nass' field of the origin 
row in origin_db will be incremented to reflect the additional associations. 

This program is useful for incorporating externally-derived collections of picks
into a copy of an existing catalog, without going through the extensive work of 
relocating all the events in a database of the combined arrivals. This can be useful if, 
for example, one needs to run scientific experiments with a set of picked data
from an external experimental network, combined with the earthquake locations from 
a main network.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This should probably be an option in dbassoc_arrival, rather than a separate program.

This program assumes there are no conflicts between any picks in the two databases.

The files arrival_db.origin and arrival_db.assoc are used as scratch space. If they 
exist (or if tables by those names are accessible through the descriptor file) 
when dbassoc_arrival_fold is launched, the program will complain and die.
