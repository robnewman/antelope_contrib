.SH DESCRIPTION
When conducting analyst-training workshops, it is common to create
a database and various other files which the analyst trainees will need
to practice workshop exercises. Often the trainees need to perform various
copying and setup tasks in order to create their own personal training
environment, usually by drawing from master copies of databases etc. This
script is an attempt to automate that setup, simplifying the job of the
workshop leader as well as allowing the trainees to focus on the main goals
without being overwhelmed by a barrage of setup tasks. Furthermore, it 
is not uncommon for trainees to create a regrettable situation in their 
practice directory, requiring a repeat of the setup tasks. \fBinit_training\fP 
makes it easier to erase mistakes and start over. 

\fBinit_training\fP is driven by named templates, which are specified in the 
parameter file init_training.pf. If there is only one template in the 
parameter file, or if the name of a template is explicitly specified on the 
command line, that template is used. Otherwise, if multiple templates 
are defined in the parameter file, init_training looks for a parameter
called \fIdefault_template\fP in the parameter file to decide which to use.

Almost all setup performed by \fBinit_training\fP is done in the 
user's home directory, in a subdirectory specified by \fIpractice_subdir\fP
of init_training.pf. The actual practice directory is a subdirectory of this, 
and is named after the template. \fBinit_training\fP will not overwrite 
a pre-existing directory, and will complain and die if there is a conflict. 

The main job of \fBinit_training\fP is to create a practice database. 
This is done by copying tables from a stock database (usually of automatically
processed results) specified by the parameters \fIautoproc_database\fP
and \fIautoproc_tables\fP. \fBinit_training\fP expects to include the 
waveforms and site information in this database by descriptor-file reference, 
thus the parameters \fIsite_database\fP and \fIwaveform_database\fP 
should specify paths to these entities. The dbpath parameter for the 
descriptor file is generated automatically. Other elements of the 
descriptor file may be added via the \fIdescriptor_elements\fP parameter
of init_training.pf. Finally, \fBinit_training\fP will create a zero-length 
lastid table for the practice database, to protect the lastid table 
for the site and waveform databases. 

\fBinit_training\fP will also copy into the training directory any files 
specified by the \fIcopy_files\fP table. Finally, any rc files specified 
in the \fIrcfiles\fP array will be copied into the user's home directory 
(with a leading '.'). Pre-existing rc files of the same name will be moved 
to an identical file with the suffix of ".before_training".
