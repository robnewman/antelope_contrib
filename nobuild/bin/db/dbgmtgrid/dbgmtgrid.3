.TH DBGMTGRID 3 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
dbgmtgrid \- perl routines to construct gmt grid from database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
require "dbgmtgrid.pl";

$rc = dbgmtgrid( @db, $rectangle, $outfile
		      [, verbose => 1 ]
		      [, spacing => dx[m|c][/dy[m|c]]
		      [, workdir => directory] )
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbgmtgrid takes an input view containing records of a gmt1.0 database. 
Applying the gmt commands grdcut(1), grdedit(1), and grdpaste(1), it cuts out 
all the pieces it needs to cover the requested region and writes the 
resulting grid to the specified output file. If an optional nonzero $verbose
argument is specified, all commands are run in verbose mode. The dbgmtgrid 
program tests the input rectangle against the database entries at several 
different phase-wrapping values, allowing request regions to be specified in 
the most convenient way for the user and nevertheless produce the expected 
output (provided, of course, that the region of interest is represented 
in one form or another in the database). If the rectangle is specified 
with an eastern longitude numerically less than the western longitude
(e.g. 178/-177), the eastern longitude will be phase-unwrapped by 360
degrees (producing a grid from 178 to 183 degrees in the previous example).

If the spacing option is specified, the grid will be resampled to the 
specified spacing. An 'm' or 'c' appended indicates minutes or seconds, 
respectively.

If the workdir option is specified, the named directory will be used 
as a temporary working area. Otherwise /tmp is used.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
dbgmtgrid assumes that the input database is 'reasonable'. Presumptions:

The requested region is not wider than 360 degrees;

No part of the requested region is represented more than once 
in the input view;

All files in the input view have identical dx; similarly all files 
have identical dy;

All files in the input view share the same registration type, i.e. 
pixel registration or grid registration;

The files in the input view are contiguous and rectangular in lat/lon,
and with a regular grid of boundaries.

These routines have only been tested with grids having pixel-registered nodes.

dbgmtgrid currently does not support the [r] suffix for the rectangular 
region, due to its dependence on the projection.
