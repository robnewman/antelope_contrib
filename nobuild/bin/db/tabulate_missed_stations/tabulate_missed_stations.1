.SH NAME
tabulate_missed_stations \- look for stations not in translation database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
tabulate_missed_stations transdb dbname [dbname...]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
tabulate_missed_stations searches through one or more databases for station
names which do not appear in the specified database of station-name translations. 
Both the arrival and wfdisc tables are surveyed.

A printout of missed stations includes the names of the stations missed in
each database, plus a summary over all databases of the missed station names 
with time of first occurrence and component names in the database. 

The database of station-name translations maps old station names, where
the channel and/or gain band are sometimes coded into the station-name itself, 
into CSS3.0-style station and channel codes. For example, "CRPN" translates to 
"CRP SHN". 

tabulate_missed_stations creates a database called dbmissed in the current 
working directory, listing the old station names of the missed stations. This 
allows easy updates to the translation database once the new station and 
channel names are filled in in the 'dbmissed' database.
