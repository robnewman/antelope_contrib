.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS overview
.LP
\fBdbgme\fP provides generalized gridding of 2-D surface-motion measurements,
synthetics, and combinations of the two. Measurements are grouped together
by hypothesized association with a known earthquake. Specifically, \fBdbgme\fP
takes a database of hypocenters and waveform measurements in
rt1.0-compatible format, and from them creates a plottable grid file of
some measure of the ground-motion in an area of interest. The computed
grids are stored in external files, which are referenced by rows in the
qgrid table.  The qgrid table is defined as an extension to the css3.0
schema.
.SS delegates
.LP
\fBdbgme\fP is, in essence, a general grid-regularization engine. It can
take any set of measurements made in connection with a specific origin,
and feed them to a grid-regularization function, called a delegate.  Several
delegates have been implemented directly into \fBdbgme\fP, and the user is
allowed to add more as necessary. In the latter case, the delegate should be a
C-function programmed into the Antelope user library (libuser),
or a Matlab function in a Matlab .m file.  Detailed specification of how to
write additional delegates is provided in the man page dbgme_delegates(3).
The delegates are sought first in libuser, then internally. Thus, an
installation may override the behavior of the internal delegates,
though the wisdom of this is questionable from the standpoint of
tracking what actually happened to create a given qgrid in the database
[it's probably just better to implement a new delegate under a
different name, rather than re-implement one under the same name].
The special delegate called \fImatlab\fP delegates the
computational tasks to a series of matlab commands provided by the
user.
.LP
Most commonly in the delegate functions, where possible direct measurements of ground-motion
are used. Where direct measurements are not available, they are usually
approximated from a set of instructions in the \fIrecipe\fP. The ground-motion
value may be one of several common quantities, such as Peak Ground
Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), spectrally filtered
accelerations, or instrumental modified-Mercalli intensity.
.LP
Each delegate receives two blocks of information: a database pointer
and a parameter-file. The database pointer contains the hypocenter,
arrival, and wfmgme or wfmeas waveform-measurement information appropriate for
the computation of one qgrid. The parameter file contains all necessary
parameters, including grid specifications, filenames, etc. The
parameter file is a combination of items provided by \fBdbgme\fP directly and
passed in from the delegate_pf entry in the \fIrecipe\fP (recipes are described
below).
.LP
The delegate is responsible for saving the qgrid. This is 
necessary because there may be a wide variety of applications that save
multiple qgrids in one file, with or without associations with
earthquakes etc.  However, the cggrid2db(3) function is provided to
make saving the qgrid easy.
.LP
The main delegate provided with \fBdbgme\fP is called trinetsm_es99. This delegate is intended
to implement the TriNet ShakeMap algorithm as documented in a 1999
article in Earthquake Spectra by Wald et al. This allows \fBdbgme\fP to
run in a \fIShakeMap emulation\fP mode. The trinetsm_es99 delegate, and its companion
delegate trinetsm_es99_mmi, are documented in trinetsm_es99(3).
.SS recipes
.LP
\fBdbgme\fP is based on recipes. Each qgrid that it computes is generated
according to a \fIrecipe\fP, i.e. a list of parameters, which may have a number of
arbitrary parameters as well as some standard ones. The most important part
of a \fIrecipe\fP is the name of the delegate function which does its computation.
Many different recipes can use the same delegate function. When running \fBdbgme\fP,
at least one \fIrecipe\fP must be specified, although it is permissible to request
more than one \fIrecipe\fP (i.e. more than one output qgrid) at once.
.LP
All \fBdbgme\fP recipes are specified in the main parameter file for \fBdbgme\fP, which by default
is \fBdbgme\fP.pf. Each \fIrecipe\fP must have a unique name which identifies the
processing steps for making that type of grid.
.LP
Each \fIrecipe\fP is specified by an entry in the 'recipes' array of the
\fBdbgme\fP parameter file. Each \fIrecipe\fP must have a unique name. Each \fIrecipe\fP
must also name a function that does the grid computation, entered
in the 'delegate' field of the \fIrecipe\fP. Several recipes may share the
same delegate. For example, the sp_bssa87 delegate function supports
both the sp87_pga and sp87_pgv recipes, both of which derive from the
same 1987 BSSA paper by Sabetta and Pugliese.
.LP
Each \fIrecipe\fP also has a delegate_pf entry, the contents of which are
passed to the delegate function. The select and filter
parameters in each \fIrecipe\fP are subset expressions for the input
waveform-measurements (wfmeas or wfmgme rows).
.LP
The \fIrecipe\fP for the matlab delegate has an additional entry, a Literal
called matlab_commands containing the Matlab code to perform the
computation. This code may be entered directly in the parameter file
or, for cases where that becomes unwieldy, the code can be
reduced to a single-line function call which is available along
the Matlab path. As a default, \fBdbgme\fP ensures that the
directory $ANTELOPE/data/matlab/antelope/scripts is available
to the Matlab engine during the run, suggesting a default location
for such scripts.
.LP
A number of parameters, such as output_file, qgridfmt, auth, etc (see the
example below) are used so commonly in recipes that they have been
put in a separate array for default parameters, called delegate_pf_defaults.
All the parameters in this array are added automatically to each
\fIrecipe\fP in the parameter file, though they may be overridden in individual
recipes. The recipe name and delegate function name (\fIrecipe_name\fP and 
\fIdelegate\fP, respectively) are also replicated
in the parameter file handed to each delegate.
.LP
The output_file parameter is a pattern that is passed to trwfname(3), which
generates the filename of the qgrid external file. Note that all fields
of the qgrid table are accessible in this filename pattern via
the %{field} replacement syntax of trwfname(3). For more detail see
the man page on that command. The qgridfmt parameter specifies the
external storage format of the qgrid files. For currently supported
formats see the man page cggrid(5).
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -f
Force. This option forces rewrites of pre-existing database rows.
By default, \fBdbgme\fP does not overwrite conflicting items.
.IP "-r \fIrecipe\fP"
This option names one of the recipes to apply from the
parameter file. More than one \fIrecipe\fP may be specified, in which
case all applicable recipes are run on each relevant dataset.
.IP "-o \fIorid\fP"
This option allows the user to generate a qgrid for a
specific \fIorid\fP.
.IP "-p pffile"
Specify the parameter-file for \fBdbgme\fP. The default is
\fBdbgme\fP.pf.
.IP -d
Run as a daemon

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The qgrid table is structured to support unprojected grids. This
is by intent. It is the responsibility of the end user to project
the grid to any representative flat surface.
.LP
The \fBdbgme\fP delegation to Matlab is done via pipes to the
command-line-callable matlab executable, rather than via the Matlab
engOpen() series of routines.  This decouples \fBdbgme\fP compilation
from any direct linking against the shared-libraries of Matlab, which
themselves can vary in location from installation to installation.  The
advantage of this is a site-independent compile. The expense is a loss
of some control over error handling in the Matlab routines: little
handling of failures is currently in place. If problems are encountered
during the execution of a matlab delegate, the user is left at a Matlab
command prompt to debug the difficulties.
.LP
The daemon mode is based on monitoring the size of the origin 
table. When this table grows, \fBdbgme\fP checks to see if any grids
need to be generated. Grids that already exist are not updated, and
no care is taken at the moment to assure all data for a given
hypocenter have arrived. After the first grid is generated, further
updates need to be done manually.
.LP
It would also be possible to support shell delegates (i.e. command-line
callable delegates) without much difficulty.
.LP
Computation of grids based on time-windows instead of hypocenters could be
added, which would allow continuous computation of ground motion for a 
region, independent of any hypocenters. Some hooks are already present 
for this.
