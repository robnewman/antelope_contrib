.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include "dbgme.h"

int \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP(Dbptr \fIdb\fP, Pf *\fIpf\fP)
int \fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP(Dbptr \fIdb\fP, Pf *\fIpf\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines are delegate functions to compute ground-motion estimates
via the dbgme(1) program. These functions are not meant to be called
directly by user programs. The \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP and \fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP functions
provide ground-motion computations that approximate the method described
in Wald et al. 1999, although there are some differences.
.LP
The \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP function provides two modes of operation, 'pga' and 'pgv'. The
former computes peak ground acceleration estimates; the
latter computes peak ground velocity estimates. The \fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP
delegate has only one mode of operation, which relies (usually) on the
previous outputs of the \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP delegate.
.LP
The following parameters are used in the dbgme.\fIpf\fP parameter file for these
delegates.
.LP
.SS "Parameters shared by both delegates:"
.LP
.IP \fIoutput_file\fP
This parameter specifies the filename of the output qgrid file, in the
form of string to be fed to trwfname(3). The string is interpreted
in the context of the qgrid table, thus qgrid-table field names may
be interspersed in the value. For example, a common setting for this
parameter may be "%Y/%j/%{qgridname}_%{recipe}.%{qgridfmt}" (without the
quotes, of course).
.LP
.IP \fIqgridfmt\fP
This parameter specifies the output storage format for the qgrid file,
for example 'as' for ascii or 't4' for four-byte float. For supported
formats, see cggrid(5).
.LP
.IP \fIauth\fP
This parameter specifies the author of the qgrid, to be saved in the
qgrid table's 'auth' field.
.LP
.IP \fIwdellon\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees longitude, how far west the western edge
of the qgrid should be from the center (usually the center of the
qgrid is at the hypocenter of the earthquake in question).  Normally
this should be specified as a negative value, e.g. -1.
.LP
.IP \fIedellon\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees longitude, how far east the eastern edge
of the qgrid should be from the center (usually the center of the
qgrid is at the hypocenter of the earthquake in question).  Normally
this should be specified as a positive value, e.g. 1.
.LP
.IP \fIsdellat\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees latitude, how far south the southern edge
of the qgrid should be from the center (usually the center of the
qgrid is at the hypocenter of the earthquake in question).  Normally
this should be specified as a negative value, e.g. -1.
.LP
.IP \fIndellat\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees latitude, how far north the northern edge
of the qgrid should be from the center (usually the center of the
qgrid is at the hypocenter of the earthquake in question).  Normally
this should be specified as a positive value, e.g. 1.
.LP
.IP \fIqdlat\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees longitude, the east-west spacing of the
points in the output qgrid.
.LP
.IP \fIqdlon\fP
This parameter specifies, in degrees latitude, the north-south spacing of the
points in the output qgrid.
.LP
.IP \fIqgridtype\fP
This parameter specifies what type of grid to calculate: e.g. 'pga' or 'pgv'
(for the \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP delegate) or 'mmi' (for the \fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP delegate).
.LP
.IP \fIoutput_units\fP
This parameter specifies the output units for the qgrid. Reasonable choices
for 'pga', 'pgv', and 'mmi' grids are, respectively, 'gravity', 'cm/sec', and 'mmi'.
.LP
.SS "Parameters specific to the trinetsm_es99 delegate:"
.LP
.IP \fIphantom_spacing_deg\fP
This is the spacing of the grid of phantom stations to compute from the
attenuation regression, to be used in generating the QuakeMap. A value
of 0.3 provides similarity to the Wald et al. (1999) computation (see p. 540).
.LP
.IP \fIphantom_mindist_deg\fP
Phantom stations closer than this distance (commonly 0.3 degrees) to a real
measurement are discarded before computing the QuakeMap grid. See
Wald et al. (1990) p. 540.
.LP
.IP \fIcentroid_mindist_deg\fP
Phantom stations closer than this distance (commonly 0.1 degrees) to
the earthquake hypocenter are discarded before computing the
QuakeMap grid.
.LP
.IP \fIconst_coeff\fP
This is the additive constant in the equation for log(PGA) or log(PGV).
In Joyner/Boore (1981), these are -1.02 (equation 4) and -0.67 (equation
6), respectively.
.LP
.IP \fImag_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient of the magnitude term in the log(PGA) and log(PGV)
equations. In Joyner/Boore (1981), this is 0.249 (equation 4) or
0.489 (equation 6), respectively.
.LP
.IP \fIr_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient of the distance (r) term in the log(PGA) and log(PGV)
equations. In Joyner/Boore (1981), this is 0.00255 (equation 4) or
0.00256 (equation 6), respectively.
.LP
.IP \fIP_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient of the P term in the log(PGA) and log(PGV)
equations. In Joyner/Boore (1981), this is 0.26 (equation 4) or
0.22 (equation 6), respectively.
.LP
.IP \fIP\fP
This is the value of P in Joyner/Boore (1981) equation 4 (for PGA) or
equation 6 (for PGV). P equals zero for 50 percent probability that the
prediction of the regression exceeds the real value and one
for 84 percent probability, assuming normally distributed errors.
.LP
.IP \fIS_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient of the S term in equation 6 of Joyner/Boore (1981).
S is not used for PGA computation and should be set to zero. 0.17 is
the value used in Joyner/Boore for PGV computation. S is one for
soil sites, zero for rock sites.
.LP
.IP \fIS_hardrock_cutoff_mps\fP
This defines a cutoff Vs30 value in meters/sec, above which a site is
assumed to be rock for the S-factor in Joyner/Boore equation 6;
see the S_coeff parameter above.
.LP
.IP \fIr_offset\fP
This is the offset value used in computing the distance r to the earthquake
for the regression. If 'd' is the closest distance to the surface projection
of the fault rupture in km, r=sqrt(d^2 + r_offset^2).
.LP
.IP \fItension\fP
This parameter sets the spline tension for
cggrid_splinefit_pointset(3), used when fitting the grid of phantom
(i.e. predicted from the attenuation regression) and real measurements
to a smooth surface for the output qgrid. A recommended value for this
parameter is 0.4.
.LP
.IP \fIoverrelaxation\fP
This parameter sets the overrelaxation parameter for
cggrid_splinefit_pointset(3), used when fitting the grid of phantom
measurements (i.e. those predicted from the attenuation regression) and
real measurements to a smooth surface for the output qgrid. A recommended 
value for this parameter is 1.4.
.LP
.IP \fIconvergence\fP
This parameter sets the convergence threshold for
cggrid_splinefit_pointset(3), used when fitting the grid of phantom
measurements (i.e. those predicted from the attenuation regression) and 
real measurements to a smooth surface for the output qgrid. A recommended 
value for this parameter is 0.001.
.LP
.IP \fImax_iterations\fP
This parameter sets the maximum number of iterations for
cggrid_splinefit_pointset(3), used when fitting the grid of phantom
(i.e. predicted from the attenuation regression) and real measurements
to a smooth surface for the output qgrid. An example value for this parameter
is 1000.
.LP
.IP \fIsitecorr_file\fP
This parameter gives the filename of a grid of Vs30 (30-meter shear-wave
velocities in m/sec) for the area of interest. The grid should be stored
in cggrid(5) format.
.LP
.IP \fIvs30_default_mps\fP
This parameter gives the default Vs30 value in meters per second, should
the sitecorr_file not be found or should it not completely cover the
area of interest.
.LP
.IP \fIpga_sitecorr_cutoffs_g\fP
This parameter gives a list of acceleration values, in gravity (g), at which
the columns of the pga_sitecorr_table (see below) apply. For example,
these are commonly set to 0, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 gravity.
.LP
.IP \fIpga_sitecorr_table\fP
This table describes how to translate Vs30 values and measured/predicted
acceleration or velocity values into site amplification factors, as
tabulated in Borcherdt (1994) and described in Wald et al. (1999). The
first value in each row gives the site velocity in meters per second,
above which that row applies. the additional columns give the site
amplification factors for the various acceleration levels listed in
the pga_sitecorr_cutoffs_g parameter. For velocity site amplification
factors, only the zero-acceleration column of this matrix is used.
The example given below may help clarify the contents of this matrix.
.LP
.SS "Parameters specific to the trinetsm_es99_mmi delegate:"
.LP
.IP \fIpga_recipe\fP
This parameter gives the name of the qgrid recipe to use
for peak-ground-acceleration in the MMI computation. Usually, this is
the output of the \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP delegate running in 'pga' mode. The
\fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP delegate expects to find this grid for the origin in
question already computed in the qgrid table. If it cannot find
this grid, the delegate complains and fails.
.LP
.IP \fIpgv_recipe\fP
This parameter gives the name of the the qgrid recipe to use
for peak-ground-velocity in the MMI computation. Usually, this 
is the output of the \fBtrinetsm_es99\fP delegate running in 'pgv' mode. The
\fBtrinetsm_es99_mmi\fP delegate expects to find this grid for the origin in
question already computed in the qgrid table. If it cannot find
this grid, the delegate complains and fails.
.LP
.IP \fIlow_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient in front of the logarithm to convert PGA to MMI,
given as 2.20 in equation 3 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 546). This
formula is used to compute MMI for low-magnitude earthquakes.
.LP
.IP \fIlow_offset\fP
This is the constant added to  the logarithm of PGA to compute MMI,
given as 1.00 in equation 3 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 546). This
formula is used to compute MMI for low-magnitude earthquakes.
.LP
.IP \fIlow_cutoff_mmi\fP
This is the cutoff earthquake magnitude below which the 'low-magnitude'
formula to compute MMI is used. In Wald et al. (1999), this is specified
as magnitude 5 in the middle paragraph on p. 546.
.LP
.IP \fIpga_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient in front of the logarithm to convert PGA to MMI,
given as 3.66 in equation 1 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 545). This formula
is used to compute MMI for earthquakes with magnitude above the parameter
low_cutoff_mmi and with MMI below the limit pga_cutoff_mmi.  In practice,
this MMI result is weighted with the result from the PGV computation,
the latter being less strongly weighted for lower magnitudes, as described
in the first block of text on p. 547 of Wald et al (1999).
.LP
.IP \fIpga_offset\fP
This is the constant added to the logarithm of PGA to compute MMI,
given as -1.66 in equation 1 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 545).
.LP
.IP \fIpgv_coeff\fP
This is the coefficient in front of the logarithm to convert PGV to MMI,
given as 3.47 in equation 2 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 545). This
formula is used to compute MMI for earthquakes with magnitude above
the parameter low_cutoff_mmi.  In practice, this MMI result is weighted
with the result from the PGA computation, the latter being more
strongly weighted for lower magnitudes, as described in the first
block of text on p. 547 of Wald et al (1999).
.LP
.IP \fIpgv_offset\fP
This is the constant added to the logarithm of PGV to compute MMI,
given as 2.35 in equation 2 of Wald et al. 1999 (p. 545). This
formula is used to compute MMI for earthquakes with magnitude above
the parameter low_cutoff_mmi and with PGA-based MMI above the
parameter pga_cutoff_mmi.
.LP
.IP \fIpga_cutoff_mmi\fP
This is the cutoff MMI value above which the 'PGV'
formula to compute MMI is used exclusively. In Wald et al. (1999), this is
specified to be MMI of 7 (in the first block of text on p. 547).
