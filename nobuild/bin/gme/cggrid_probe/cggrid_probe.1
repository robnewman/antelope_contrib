.SH NAME
cggrid_probe \- probe a cggrid file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcggrid_probe\fP [-e] [-n] [-f \fIformat\fP] \fIcggridfile\fP { \fIx\fP \fIy\fP | \fIxyfile\fP }
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBcggrid_probe\fP reads a file in cggrid format (i.e. as saved by the
cggrid_write(3) routine), finds the value at the point specified by
coordinates \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP via bilinear interpolation (using
cg_biinterp(3)), and prints the value. The print \fIformat\fP may be specified
with the -f option. The \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP values on the command line 
may be replaced by a single filename \fIxyfile\fP, in which case all 
x-y pairs listed in the specified file will be converted. If \fIxyfile\fP
is specified as -, x-y pairs will be read from stdin and converted. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-f format"
output print \fIformat\fP in the style of fprintf(3C). Currently the default
is '%.3f'.
.IP -n
Do not print newline character
.IP -e
Echo input x/y value in front of the returned data value(s)
