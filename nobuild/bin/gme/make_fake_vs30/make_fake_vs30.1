.TH MAKE_FAKE_VS30 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
make_fake_vs30 \- generate a fake vs30 input file from topography data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBmake_fake_vs30 \fP[-V] -Rw/e/s/n
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Two-dimensional ground-motion estimation often requires a grid of
data values for site response over an entire area. Frequently this
is implemented with a digitized map of 30-meter shear-wave velocities,
or \fIVs30\fP. Unfortunately those values require extensive effort to obtain.
To prevent delays in configuration of a real-time system,
it is useful to create a dummy data-set for testing. One convenient
way to do this is to assign nonsense Vs30 values based on the gradient of
topography.
.LP
The \fBmake_fake_vs30\fP script takes a database of GMT grid files (as in
the dbgmtgrid(1) program), then computes the normalized gradient of
the topography. Zero gradient is assigned a low Vs30, high gradient is
assigned a high Vs30 value, and values in between are obtained from
linear interpolation between these two. The Vs30 values are output as a
GMT grid file, as an ascii file in cggrid(5) format, and as a rudimentary 
postscript plot.
.LP
The \fIgrid_database\fP parameter gives the name of the Antelope database
of GMT grid files with topography information. This database
should be in gmt1.0 format. The parameters \fIvs30_min_mps\fP and
\fIvs30_range_mps\fP give the minimum Vs30 and the range of Vs30 in meters
per second, respectively. The gradient of the topography is generated
with grdgradient(1), given the \fIgradient_options\fP
parameter.  The \fIvs30_colormap_interval_mps\fP and
colormap parameters are given to the GMT makecpt(1) command
to generate a colormap for the output map. The \fIpsbasemap_boundary\fP
value is given to psbasemap(1) with the -B option, and the \fIprojection\fP
parameter is used to generate the map.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBmake_fake_vs30\fP requires a number of GMT programs which must 
be available on its path. \fBmake_fake_vs30\fP will complain and 
die if any of these are not found.
.LP
\fBmake_fake_vs30\fP leaves a number of intermediate files in the run
directory which may be of interest to the user, or alternatively may need
to be cleaned up by the user.
.LP
No basis in scientific reasoning or fact is expressed or implied
by this program. The sole purpose of the script is to create a dataset
for testing software setup. 
.LP
The map is intended solely for a quick check of the output. If fancier 
maps are desired they should be made directly from the output data grids.
.LP
Note: This script was initially written in 2003, based on ideas suggested 
by Dr. Danny Harvey. Subsequently, the topographic slope approach has
been published by Wald, D.J., P.S. Earle, and V. Quitoriano
(2004) "Topographic Slope as a Proxy for Seismic Site Amplification Correction", 
Eos Trans. AGU 85(47), Fall Meet. Suppl., Abstract S42A-01. The Wald et al.
abstract, q.v., contains discussion of calibrating the topographic-slope
technique against a geologically based site-condition map for California.
