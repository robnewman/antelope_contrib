.SH NAME
shakemapgrid2cggrid \- convert a ShakeMap XYZ grid file to a cggrid
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBshakemapgrid2cggrid [-pf pfname] { \fIgridfile\fP | -event \fIevent_id\fP }
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBshakemapgrid2cggrid\fP command converts an XYZ output grid file from 
the USGS ShakeMap program into an ascii computational-geometry grid from the
cgeom(3) library.

\fBshakemapgrid2cggrid\fP has two modes, grid-mode and event-mode.
In grid-mode, a grid-file name is explicitly specified on the command line and 
converted. In event-mode, i.e. if the -event option is used, the given
event_id value will be used to find the corresponding ShakeMap output grid, 
and that grid will be converted and then saved to a database. This latter 
case assumes that the event_id is identical to the evid in the database, and 
that the ShakeMap being converted is for the preferred origin for that evid. 

The shakemap_grids table in the parameter file specifies the columns of
the ShakeMap grid that are to be converted to cggrid files. These must
be in the same order as they appear in the ShakeMap grid file, with the
one option that only as many columns will be converted as there are
rows in the shakemap_grids table. Each row of the shakemap_grids table
specifies first the type of the output cggrid, and second the units (as
documented for the Antelope units_convert(3) and xunits(1) commands) in which the input
values are expressed. The third argument is the name of the recipe to
use when saving the resulting grids in a database. The first field, the
type of the output cggrid, is used as the \fIqgridtype\fP when saving
grids to the database.

The output cggrid files are saved in files named with the grid type
given in the shakemap_grids table, prepended with the value of
gridmode_cggrid_prefix and followed by a suffix indicating the cggrid
format (for example \fI.as\fP or \fI.t4\fP).

The event_mode array of the parameter specifies several values needed to 
run shakemapgrid2cggrid from within ShakeMap, i.e. in event mode. These 
are \fIsmgrid_dir\fP for the directory in which to find the ShakeMap 
output grid (the string $event_id may appear in this value, to be replaced
by the actual event-id at run-time). The \fIsmgrid_name\fP specifies the name
of the ShakeMap xyz grid file in that directory.  The \fIdbname\fP field 
specifies the name of the database in which hypocentral information may be 
found for the event and in which qgrid rows will be saved. The \fIoutput_file\fP
parameter gives a pattern to be fed to epoch2str(3) to determine the 
pathname of the output qgrid file based on the origin time of the event. 
Several additional escape strings may be supplied in this pattern: %{qgridname},
%{recipe}, %{qgridfmt}, %{qgridtype}, and %{auth}. Again, this will be 
filled-in dynamically during grid creation. The grid name will be determined 
based on the orid for the grid. The \fIauth\fP field of the event_mode 
array will be used to label the author of the qgrid in the qgrid table of the 
database. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-pf pfname"
Specify an alternate parameter-file name. The default is shakemapgrid2cggrid.pf

.IP "-event event_id" 
Specify the event-id for the ShakeMap grid file to convert

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
shakemapgrid2cggrid assumes, without checking, that the input grid is 
regularly spaced (i.e. the grid-point spacing is taken from the separation
between the first two latitudes and the first two longitudes in the input file). 
In event mode, shakemapgrid2cggrid uses the specified event id as an evid
in the database, finds the prefor for that event, and uses that prefor 
for the orid when saving the converted grids to the qgrid table. This 
may not be right in all cases.  The current behavior is designed to 
coordinate with db2shakemap_xml. Also, there is a small possibility of timing 
problems if the prefor is reset while ShakeMap is running. This is a nontrivial
structural problem which needs to be addressed both in the current 
script and in db2shakemap_xml(1).
