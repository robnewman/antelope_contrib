.SH NAME
shakemapxml2db \- Create database from USGS ShakeMap XML data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
shakemapxml2db xmlfile [xmlfile...] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
shakemapxml2db takes XML data from the USGS ShakeMap program and 
creates a test database representing the data. Conversion is 
approximate and meant for scaffolding purposes and debugging. 

For each station, shakemapxml2db predicts the P-phase arrival, 
assigning a measurement time at the P-phase time with a validity
interval extending from the predicted arrival to a time P+2S later.
These predicted arrivals are added as "+P" to the arrival and assoc tables,
with the arid used in wfmeas.

shakemapxml2db expects each xml document to contain one shakemap-data 
element, which in turn contains one each of the earthquake and stationlist
elements. The latter in turn contains station elements, each with one or more
comp elements, each with one or more measurements that are either acc, vel, 
psa03, psa10, or psa30. For further detail see the ShakeMap documentation
(approx. version 2.4). For compatibility with orbwfmeas databases, 
the 'acc' and 'vel' tags are renamed 'peaka' and 'peakv' in the meastype 
field of the wfmeas table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The magnitude listed in the XML file is always entered as an ML.

The filter for wfmeas is listed as "UNKNOWN". The ondate for site/sitechan is
1970001.

A more sophisticated version might check for existing site/sitechan
entries and defer to them. This is a low-investment script, thus the
created site/sitechan can be discarded if one has a better site
database.

shakemapxml2db is careful not to add duplicate origin and
arrival rows. However, it will put wfmeas rows in the database regardless
of any matching keys. This situation occurs in some TriNet data sets; 
handling the confusion is left to downstream processors.

shakemapxml2db  skips stations with codes more than 6 characters,
complaining as it does so.

shakemapxml2db converts data apparently labeled as Troubled (flag='T').
This may or may not be desirable (good for testing, though).

shakemapxml2db does not fill in arrival.chan for the synthetic arrivals, 
since one arrival may apply to more than one waveform-measurement for a 
station. Programs using the resulting database should therefore select 
channels based on wfmeas.chan if they need to do any subsetting.
