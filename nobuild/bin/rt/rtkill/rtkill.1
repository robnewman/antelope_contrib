.TH RTKILL 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
\fBrtkill\fP \- stop and restart processes under Antelope rtexec 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBrtkill\fP -l

\fBrtkill\fP [-rvqs] \fIprocname\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrtkill\fP allows the user to stop and start processes running under an Antelope 
rtexec(1) system solely via command-line interaction (i.e. without using 
text editors on the \fIrtexec.pf\fP file or GUI tools such as rtm(1)). 

The default behavior of \fBrtkill\fP is to turn off a running process listed in the 
rtexec.pf \fIRun\fP array. However, the various options (see the OPTIONS section 
below) allow the user to start tasks that are off, restart tasks that are running, 
query the current run setting for tasks, or list configured tasks. 

\fBrtkill\fP must be run from the directory that contains the \fIrtexec.pf\fP 
file one wishes to modify. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -l
This option lists available tasks.
.IP -q
This option returns the run status of \fIprocname\fP as the exit code of the 
\fBrtkill\fP program. In verbose mode, an informative message is also printed.
.IP -r
This option restarts a task.
.IP -s
This option starts a task that is currently turned off.
.IP -v
This option triggers verbose mode.
.SH FILES
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The amount of time \fBrtkill\fP sleeps before starting a process it has just stopped 
is specified in the parameter file. This should not need to be changed under normal
conditions, however if processes are not restarting as expected, this value may need 
to be lengthened:
.nf

% pfecho rtkill

restart_sleep_time_sec  2

.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
% \fBrtkill\fP -v -r orbserver
rtkill: Process 'orbserver' turned off
rtkill: Process 'orbserver' restarted
%
.fi
.ft R

.SH RETURN VALUES
.SH LIBRARY
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBrtkill\fP  will complain and exit if the file \fI./rtexec.pf\fP is not found, 
or if the specified process name \fIprocname\fP does not appear in the \fIRun\fP 
array. 
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
rtm(1), rtexec(1), rtrun(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The -l option bases its return values on the \fIRun\fP array in \fIrtexec.pf\fP.
If this is out of sync with the Processes array, \fBrtkill\fP may not execute as expected.

\fBrtkill\fP does not respect upper and lower case in process names. This may be a mistake, 
however it should also encourage sensible choices for process names. 

\fBrtkill\fP does not actually interact with real unix processes. It just modifies \fIrtexec.pf\fP
and expects rtexec(1) to do the right thing in response.

In verbose mode, \fBrtkill\fP asks before restarting a process (using the \fI-r\fP option) that is
turned off. In normal mode it just turns it on. 

One could imagine other options, such as a \fI-a\fP for all, or \fI-e regex\fP for all tasks 
matching some regular expression.
