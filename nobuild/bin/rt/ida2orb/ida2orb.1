.SH NAME
ida2orb \- import data from an IDA hub to an Antelope ORB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
ida2orb [-r sec] [-u] orbname idahost importstring
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

*************************DEPRECATED******************************

ida2orb is DEPRECATED and quite likely not to work properly due to changes
in the IDA servers. Please switch to the replacement \fBisi2orb\fP
program in the Antelope contributed-code repository. 

*************************DEPRECATED******************************

ida2orb takes data from an IDA hub and imports it into an Antelope
O-Ring Buffer (ORB). The IDA connection is established and tapped with
David Chavez's idatap library. 
.LP
orbname is an internet address (or address:port) on which the orbserver
is running. idahost is the internet address of the ida server software.

importstring specifies the station(s) and channel(s) to import (see example
below). 
.LP
If the IDA channel-name is three characters or less, the orb channel name
will be set to the IDA channel name and the loc code will be left empty. 
If the IDA channel-name is more than three characters, the fourth and fifth
characters will be mapped to the loc code of the orb packet.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -u 
convert station and channel names to uppercase

.IP "-r seconds" 
reject packets that are more than the specified number of seconds into the future, according to the system clock
