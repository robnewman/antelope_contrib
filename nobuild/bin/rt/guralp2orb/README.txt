guralp2orb has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because
it has been deprecated. The program may still work and may be 
of value, however the author(s) offer absolutely no promises or 
support for it. Guralp2orb is based on very old coding of protocols
and has not been kept up to date. In addition, it implements a 
fragile architecture of collecting data from a PC running Guralp Scream 
software rather than interacting with the dataloggers themselves. 
If guralp2orb is of interest, it needs to be rewritten from first principles 
based on modern documentation of the protocols, and engineered to 
interact directly with the Guralp dataloggers.
