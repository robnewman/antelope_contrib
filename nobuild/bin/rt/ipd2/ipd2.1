.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBipd2\fP reads raw data packets from an \fIinport\fR input port; 
tries to recognize what type of a packet is a raw data packet; 
pre-appends a specific header to each raw packet and stores it in
an \fBorb\fP ring buffer.
.LP
Seismic data can be transmitted from stations via VHF or 
directly to a \fBReal-Time Data Acquisition System (RTDAS)\fP. 
An \fBRTDAS\fP is a UNIX based system and can 
be implemented on any computers running UNIX.
.LP
The current \fBRTDAS\fP system is designed to support any input ports \fIinport\fR
to retrieve seismic data. The data can be retrieve from High Speed 
Serial card, standard serial ports, over an Ethernet port, 
a socket connection, etc. The limitation on type of input ports 
is determined only by the UNIX system. Any ports/devices which are 
supported by the UNIX system can be used as \fBRTDAS\fP data input port. 
Several different ports can be used for simultaneous feeding of different
types of seismic data to the \fBRTDAS\fP \fIorb\fR ring buffer.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c check_tim_intv"
In a case where \fBipd2\fP can't recognize the input packet or can't find specific 
parameters for the input packet, it tries to re-read the parameter file, since a 
parameter file could be edited after \fBipd2\fP was started. Packets can arrive
with a high speed ( for example one packet per second), therefore it's not a  good idea to try
to re-read the parameter file every time ipd2 has a lack of information. There 
should be a time interval between re-reading of the parameter file by \fBipd2\fP.
This option sets such time interval - \fI check_tim_intv\fR. The default value
is 30 minutes. 
.IP "-i"
Tells \fBipd2\fP not to send \fIDC Status Packets\fR to orb.
.IP "-p parameter-file"
A parameter file \fIparameter-file\fR will be used to get parameters for a raw 
data packet, its type, header type; to get station and channel name codes
for each component of a raw data packet. A \fBpkt.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.
.IP "-s pkt-size"
Specify a raw packets size. This parameter is used in memory allocation for handling
raw packets. Default size is 4096 bytes.
.IP "-t timeout "
This option is valid only for a socket connection and specifies the number of
seconds to wait for data on a connected socket before closing the socket and opening a
new connection. Default value is 30 seconds.
.IP "-u "
Uncompress seismic data before putting them on an \fIorb\fR ring buffer.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.
.SH EXAMPLE

ring buffer on bbarray host .
