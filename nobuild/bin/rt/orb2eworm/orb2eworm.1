.SH NAME
orb2eworm \- module to export waveform data from an Antelope ORB to an 
Earthworm system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orb2eworm parameter_file.d
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
orb2eworm is deprecated; orb2ew(1) should be used instead. 

orb2eworm takes waveform-data packets from an Antelope ORB and puts them in
TYPE_TRACEBUF format onto an Earthworm shared-memory ring. orb2eworm is designed
to be one component of a running earthworm system. It was written with the v4.0
release of Earthworm from the USGS. 

The parameter file specifies the name of the orbserver containing the waveform data.

The parameter file also contains two strings, ChannelSelect and ChannelReject,
which if non-null are used as regular expressions to limit which stations
are exported from the ORB to Earthworm. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The Earthworm run directory must be specified in EW_PARAMS. 

The environment-variable SITE_DB must specify the name of a site database in 
iceworm1.3 format containing information on the station-channels being imported.

ChannelSelect  ""            # Regular-expression match for data streams to import
ChannelReject  ""            # Regular-expression match for data streams not to import
