	Detail {
		For situations in which messages are sent to 
		several parties in succession, usually with 
		time delays, until the message is acknowledged, 
		this field records the time delay used for each 
		recipient. For recipients in the first 
		batch of potential responders, delaysec will be 0. 
		For those in successive attempts to 
		communicate, delaysec will be progressively larger
		positive values, with the exact values depending on
		the configuration of the calldown lists.

		This table tracks attempts to notify staff members
		about alarm conditions in the network. The time field
		in this table indicates the system-clock timestamp 
		at which a particular message was sent to the

		from the time at which the alarm was declared, i.e. 
		alarms.time, and also different from the time of the 
		earth event of interest, e.g. origin.time).
