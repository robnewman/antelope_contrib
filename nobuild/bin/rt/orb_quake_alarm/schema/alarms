		This may be a name, username, email address, or 
		similar appropriate string.
	}
	;

Attribute acknowledged
	String (2)
	Format ( "%-2s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Range ( "acknowledged =~ /y|n/" )
	Description ( "Whether an alarm has been acknowledged" )
	Detail {
		This field records whether an alarm 
		has been acknowledged.
	}
	;

Attribute acktime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "time of alarm acknowledgment" )
	Detail {
		This field records when an alarm 
		has been acknowledged.
	}

Attribute alarmid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "alarmid > 0" )
	Description ( "alarm id" )
	Detail {
		This field provides a unique integer ID for 
		each alarm issued.
	}
	;

Attribute alarmname
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "name of alarm" )
	Detail {
		This field gives a standardized name for each 
		alarm, usually specifying some kind of template 
		that provides a useful shorthand identifier for 
		alarm condition and recipient list. These alarmnames are 
		generally configured in the alarm-generation software, 
		with names such as "beeper_duty" or "large_local" etc.
	}
	;

Attribute alarmclass
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "type of alarm" )
	Detail {
		This field gives a standardized class for each 
		type of alarm, for example "hypocenter" for 
		automatic earthquake locations or "accel" for 
		raw strong-motion acceleration exceedences. Generally 
		there will be a direct correspondence between the 
		alarmclass and the incoming packet types which are 
		analyzed to produce the alarms, for example "/db/origin"
		packets for "hypocenter" alarms. 
	}
	;

Attribute alarmkey
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "key identifying a particular alarm" )
	Detail {
		This field gives a unique key for each 
		alarm. The format of the key will vary depending on the
		class of the alarm. For example, for alarmclass "hypocenter" 
		alarms the alarm key will often be "evidNNNN" or 
		similar. Usually a maximum of one alarm of each alarmname
		will be issued for a given alarmkey. 
	}
	;

	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Subject of an email alarm" )

		sent out.

	Primary ( alarmkey alarmclass alarmname )
	Alternate ( alarmid )
	Foreign ( evid orid ) 
	Defines alarmid
	Description ( "alarm conditions" )
	Detail {
		The alarms table tracks discrete-time events for 
		which the automated system needs to notify human 
		staff and/or transfer control to human staff. The time 
		field in the alarms table indicates the system-clock timestamp 
		at which the alarm was declared (note that this could be 
		different than the time of interest for the earth event, 
		for example the hypocenter origin time, and could also be 
		different from the time at which a notification message
		was sent, if there are delays specified for each calldown
		recipient).
