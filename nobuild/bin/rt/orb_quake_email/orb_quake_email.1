.SH NAME
orb_quake_email \- email reports of earthquakes from origin rows on orb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orb_quake_email [-pf pffile] [-n npkts] [-start {OLDEST|NEWEST|time}] orbserver
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

orb_quake_email is deprecated. Consider switching to the orb_quake_alarm(1)
program.

orb_quake_email watches an Antelope ORB-server for hypocenters,
announced as database rows of the CSS3.0 origin table. Upon detection
of new hypocenters, orb_quake_email will mail a notification to the
email addresses in the parameter file. Orb_quake_email requires a
database of places (in places1.2 format) from which to calculate the
distance of the detected earthquake. The pathname to this database is
also in the parameter file. If the dist_cutoff_km parameter is not 
blank and not zero, places farther than the specified number of 
kilometers from the epicenter will not be included in the report.

Orb_quake_email will echo a copy of each message to stdout.

The pathname for the mail program to be used is specified in the mailx
parameter of the parameter file. This program should take arguments 
appropriate for the Unix mailx(1) command. 

The array specifying email recipients may contain a subsetting expression 
for the origin-table row, filtering out unwanted origins.

orb_quake_email dynamically rereads its parameter file for each hypocenter
being reported. 
.SH OPTIONS
