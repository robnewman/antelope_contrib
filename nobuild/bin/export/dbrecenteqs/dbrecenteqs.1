dbrecenteqs \- maintain a web site showing recent earthquakes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbrecenteqs \fP[-p \fIpffile\fP] [-v] [-h] [-u] [-e \fIevid\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP watches a real-time database of hypocenters,
customizing pregenerated stock maps for an entire region and creating
individual maps for each earthquake as it occurs. \fBdbrecenteqs\fP
creates the html code for a complete web-site of recently detected
earthquakes. If the keep_ndays parameter-file option is specified, the
database is cleaned up routinely upon each run. If keep_ndays is not
specified or is set to 0, no cleanup is performed.

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP is designed to be run out of the crontab table of
rtexec(1).  See the example below. If the -u option is used, \fBdbrecenteqs\fP
will die if it detects another copy of itself running. The -u
option is deprecated for \fBdbrecenteqs\fP running under the rtexec(1) of
Antelope 4.5 or higher.

If necessary, \fBdbrecenteqs\fP creates or adds to the mapstock table of the
database in dbrecenteqs1.2 or related schema.  For the default
behavior, a new stock index map is created based on the specifications
in the parameter file. The index maps (maps showing overviews of all the
earthquakes in the database) that should be shown are given in the
table overview_maps of the \fBdbrecenteqs\fP parameter file. Each entry is
the name of an array that must also be found in the parameter file.
The 'source' parameter of this array can be 'dynamic', in which case
the map is generated according to the parameters given; or it can be
the name of a pregenerated gif image and its associated parameter file, in the
style of dbevents.

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP creates HTML output in two stages. First it creates XML
files of the relevant information from the database, together with
pathnames and statistics on any image files it has generated; then
it applies an XSLT stylesheet to the XML to create HTML.

Currently there are two classes of web pages made by \fBdbrecenteqs\fP.
The first is the \fIindex map\fP web page, containing an overview of a region.
The second is the \fIfocus map\fP web page, containing information
for an individual earthquake. There is one focus map per earthquake
(\fIevid\fP), although that map may contain information about multiple
hypocentral solutions (origins).

Multiple instances of \fBdbrecenteqs\fP may be run simultaneously,
provided they are in separate subdirectories and only one instance
is running on a given database.

If the parameter use_qgrids is enabled and the database contains
the gme1.0 expansion schema and a qgrid table, contours of 
measured/predicted earth shaking are shown on the focus maps. 

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP is able to optionally mask out trouble regions in GMT
maps with a colortable different than the main colortable for the 
image. Land areas that are officially below sea level can show up 
erroneously blue when using a land/sea colormap. These may be 
masked out with a different colormap, map_landmask_palette_file, that 
is the same as map_color_palette_file for all but the underwater values. 
Areas to mask out are specified in the landmask_regions array of the
map_config blocks, with each area being listed in the form of a 
GMT-style Rectangle specification (with the -R prefix, and not supporting
the 'r' suffix). 

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP requires PerlMagick from www.imagemagick.org, and XML::Writer,
XML::LibXML, and XML::LibXSLT from www.cpan.org. The latter
will probably require libxml2 and libxslt from www.xmlsoft.org.
.SH OPTIONS
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf

.ne 7

.IP "-p pffile"
Specify name of parameter file (default is
\fBdbrecenteqs\fP.pf)

.IP -v
verbose output

.IP "-e evid"
Refresh the page for a single \fIevid\fP, and
regenerate stock maps

.ne 7
.IP -h
don't regenerate focus maps; only recreate html

.IP "-c sourcedb"
Copy the arrival, assoc, origin, and event
tables from the specified source database to the target database.
This is useful to make \fBdbrecenteqs\fP entirely responsible
for the web database, avoiding problems of views getting
modified independently while \fBdbrecenteqs\fP is using them.
.ne 4

.IP -u
die if another instance of \fBdbrecenteqs\fP is running.
This behavior is deprecated due to the increased
discretion of the modern rtexec(1) program.

.SH PARAMETER FILE

The following is a sample parameter file. Some of the parameters
should be fairly self-explanatory.

All external files referenced in the parameter file are expected
to be either absolute path-names, or are expected to be found
in $ANTELOPE/data/\fBdbrecenteqs\fP/.  Most of the
external files referenced here are provided in the default installation, however
the user may want to modify these values and databases.
What is not provided is the optional file of GMT grid databases
for adding topography/bathymetry shading to the maps, and
the database of historical hypocenters (used for pastel-shading
of background seismicity on the maps).

Three methods are supported for converting postscript files
to pixelized images. Those are \fIalchemy\fP, using the commercial
software Image Alchemy PS from HandMade Software Inc; \fIpnm\fP using
the freely available Portable Any-Map utilities; and \fIimagick\fP,
using the freely available ImageMagick utilities.

A database of phrases describing earthquake regions may be
specified by the region_phrases_database parameter. Each region is
listed as an ordered set of points of the containing polygon.
If an earthquake is not found in one of the regions or if the
database is missing, Flinn-Engdahl regions are used.

Given a database of nearby cities (parameter cities_dbname)
in places1.2 schema, \fBdbrecenteqs\fP will compute the distance to the
nearest places. In general it will stop beyond a distance
of nearest_places{max_dist_km}, however it will always include
cities that match the regular expression given by
nearest_places{always_include}.

If the keep_ndays parameter is missing or 0, no cleanup of the
target database is performed. Otherwise, hypocenters older
than the specified time are removed.

There are a couple stock arrays in the parameter file that
will probably not need to be changed, at least not often. These
are the credits and the other_regions links. An effort should be
made to incorporate the credits in the final web pages, due to
the valuable contributions of the listed parties.

The XSLT stylesheets to use for creating HTML are specified
by their filenames in the stylesheet parameter of each index-map
configuration block in the parameter file.

Each map or type of map is specified in an associative array ("hash")
in the parameter file. For clarity, the
special entry \fIinclude\fP in each of these hashes may be specified
once to include a hash of a different name. The included hash
is intended to be a set of defaults. Any parameters in the included
hash will be overridden by values that show up in the main hash
for a given map type.

The main configuration step for \fBdbrecenteqs\fP will probably be to
specify the center position of the index_map via latc and lonc.
Also one may want to choose a reasonable geographic extent for this
map via left_dellon, right_dellon, up_dellat, and down_dellat. For the
focus_map, the center lat and lon and the base filename are
determined automatically at run time. However, the geographic extent
variables may be set here (although 2 degrees in each direction seems to work
well). The cities_dbname may be specified in each of these to
determine which cities will be plotted on the maps. Multiple
databases with different levels of detail may be desirable.
Another parameter to change will be the contour_mode, specifying
how any topography shading is done. \fInone\fP means no shaded topography.
A contour mode of \fIgrddb\fP will generate topography shading from a database
of grid files, using the dbgmtgrid(3) command. This is the recommended
approach.
The parameter longitude_branchcut_high should be either 180 or 360,
depending on whether the phase of the specified grid files has
been unwrapped.
The parameters pixels_per_inch and size_inches determine the
size of the final pixelized map. The parameter reserve_colors is
critical to allow symbols to be drawn on the map image.
All line files in the linefiles array are plotted on the maps, using the
GMT pen specifications as in the example below. The detail_density
parameter is passed to GMT.

The authtrans array gives a set of regular expressions, against which
the origin.auth field of each hypocenter is matched. If a match occurs,
the author is translated to the specified text string and
given the associated URL. Further decisions on what to do with that
are up to the stylesheet author. Although the example parameter file
only shows one entry per institution, this mechanism can be used to
point each hypocentral solution at the home page of the responsible analyst.
Note that when traversing this table, the first matching regular expression
is used. Thus, careful regular-expression writing may be necessary
if one obtains unexpected results. In general, simple, intuitive entries should suffice.
If no matching regular expression is found, the auth field is left untranslated, 
i.e. identical to its entry in the database, and the url is left blank. The 'authoritative' 
field for each entry in the authtrans field is passed through to 
the XML files created by dbrecenteqs. This is useful for some web-page applications.

.SH EXAMPLE
The rtexec.pf file for a running Antelope system might contain a
line like this, which runs dbrecenteqs on a near-real-time
database once every five minutes:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 5

crontab &Arr{
dbrecenteqs UTC 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * dbrecenteqs /iwrun/bak/db/webquakes/quakes
}

.fi
.in
.ft R

To force by hand an evid to be updated:

%\fB rtrun dbrecenteqs -e 5225 db/quakes\fP

(assuming you're in the rtexec run directory; exact details will vary
according to your installation)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

"Processing instruction target begins with 'xml' at /opt/antelope/4.5p/bin/dbrecenteqs line 882", "Processing instruction target begins with 'xml' at /opt/antelope/4.5p/bin/dbrecenteqs line 1656": 
These are apparently non-fatal messages from XML::Writer. The relevant 
code is taken from the XML::Writer man-page, which may be deviating 
slightly from the XML specification. Thes messages may be safely ignored. 

"Couldn't find alchemy. Use alternate image-conversion method or fix
path." This message indicates that the ImageAlchemyPS software package
from HandMade Software
Inc., is not installed or not available on the path. A different
image conversion method, such as \fIpnm\fP or \fIimagick\fP, should be specified in
the parameter file's pixfile_conversion_method field.

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP will fail and die if its top-level directory does not
exist. This is an intentional safety feature to help keep from
building huge web directories where they don't belong.

\fBdbrecenteqs\fP will fail and die if expected to regenerate a map for which
a pixel-file already exists. [The exception is for focus maps, which
are always updated dynamically]. Large index maps often take
significant time to compute, thus if they are to be overwritten it
should be intentional. The other option, providing the .pf file for the
image still exists, would be to change the 'source' parameter for the
map to be the .pf file for the image.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Although the initial, dynamic creation of the overview maps can be
time-consuming, this should not cause concern since this configuration
step is usually done only on the first run. Once each index map is generated,
it is saved and noted in the mapstock table of the database, after
which this pregenerated map is used to create the web site. That
latter process is relatively quick. Only if these index maps are
accidentally erased (or if their corresponding database-table
entries are corrupted) will the maps have to be regenerated.

Some architecture is in place for the detail maps (maps showing
zoom-ins of particular subregions of the index maps), however this
feature is not yet supported.

Infrastructure has also been created to plot clickable stations on
the maps, together with plots of waveforms etc., however that
has not yet been implemented.

The maps written have dbevents-style parameter files, although those
omit the palette, priority, and bounding box values. These could
be fairly easily added. One catch is that while dbevents is not
picky about the name of the array of parameters in a parameter-file
for a map, \fBdbrecenteqs\fP expects this array to match the name of the map.

The code to allow exactly one instance per database may be
broken.

cities_dbname appears both in nearest_places and in map_config. It
would be nice to clean this up.

The -c \fIsourcedb\fP mechanism is something of a workaround, useful for
orbxfer -based installations, which do not have any type of synchronization
mechanism between \fBdbrecenteqs\fP and the database updates.

The -h option is aging and is not guaranteed to perform correctly in 
all circumstances.
