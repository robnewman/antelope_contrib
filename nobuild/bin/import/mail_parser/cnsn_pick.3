.SH NAME
cnsn_pick \- mail_parser handler for CNSN pick/hypocenter mail messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cnsn_pick_handler( $message, $pfarray );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cnsn_pick handler is intended to be launched by the mail_parser(1)
utility. The cnsn_pick handler takes email from the Canadian National Seismic 
Network about single-array event locations, and converts them to an 
output CSS database. The database is specified in the mail_parser.pf 
parameter file. The database may be specified with epoch2str(3) 
percent-escapes, in which case the parameter will be fed as a template to 
epoch2str against the origin time of the earthquake to decide the 
name of the output database. An additional table in the mail_parser.pf 
parameter file translates different types of message-labels into 
corresponding "auth" fields for the database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
There may be an official name for this format but I've not seen it referenced
anywhere. If there is, the name of this handler should be changed 
to reflect the format of the messages rather than one particular source 
that uses it.

There are a couple more fields in the mail messages which need to be 
explained to the author; at the moment they are ignored. The email-message 
format was reverse-engineered by inspection for the conversion. 

Sometimes multiple source queues will deliver the same email message. 
cnsn_pick puts the first one received in the database, and ignores the 
rest (by relying on the dbaddv(3) duplicate-primary-key check, then 
trapping the run-time error).
