.TH PGC_PICKFILE 3 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
pgc_pickfile \- mail_parser handler for PGC pick/hypocenter mail messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
pgc_pickfile_handler( $message, $pfarray );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pgc_pickfile handler is intended to be launched by the
mail_parser(1) utility. The pgc_pickfile handler takes
email from the Geological Survey of Canada at the Pacific
Geoscience Center, interpreting their "Loon Pickfile"
format and placing the results into a CSS database.  The
database is specified in the mail_parser.pf parameter
file.  Three additional tables in the mail_parser.pf
parameter file translate the channel names, location
programs, and Canadian velocity models into equivalent text
strings to go in the CSS database.

Note that the error ellipsoid description for LocEq generated 
errors is an approximation to the true error ellipsoid 
for this solution. It is based on the lat, lon, depth errors 
calculated at the earth's surface from LocEq; these errors are 
represented in the ellipsoid such that smajax and sminax always 
lie parallel to the earth's surface. Strike direction is 
consistent with Aki & Richards, section 4.5. 
All definitions conform with css3.0 schema definitions for 
error ellipsoid.

Sometimes a re-analysis of the same event is sent out via email. the pgc_pickfile 
handler does not account for receiving updated copies of the same earthquake.
