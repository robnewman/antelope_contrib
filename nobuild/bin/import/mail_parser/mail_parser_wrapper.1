mail_parser_wrapper\- script run by sendmail to launch mail_parser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mail_parser_wrapper
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
N.B. DISCLAIMER: All mail handling utilities in the Antelope contributed-code repository are provided as-is, with no guarantee either express or implied that they will function as desired, as described, or as expected. All risk of loss or difficulty of any sort from running these utilites is assumed solely by the end user. 

This script is used to set the environment properly so that mail_parser(1)
will run, when mail_parser(1) is used to handle an automatic email account.
It may be necessary to edit this script slightly to account for local
differences in sendmail(1) setup. 


Installing mail_parser(1) to handle mail for a given email account may 
be as simple as opening a .forward file in the home-directory of the 
account, containing the path to the mail_parser(1) command: for example

.nf
% cat /home/aeicauto/.forward
kent@giseis.alaska.edu, "|/home/aeicauto/mail_parser_wrapper || exit 75"
.fi

Note that this assumes a copy of mail_parser_wrapper has been placed in the
relevant home directory. Making a local copy is useful if any edits 
are necessary, for example to environment variables. Usually it is
necessary to remove group and world write permission from the
mail_parser_wrapper executable and from the .forward file. 

The mail_parser_wrapper may also be launched via procmail(1), approximately
as follows. First, forward recipients mail to procmail:

.nf
% cat ~/.forward 
"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"
.fi

Second, run the mail_parser_wrapper from within a procmail rule:

.nf
% cat /home/rt/.procmailrc
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Flag: Spam YES
Imapmail/Spam

:0w
|/home/rt/mail_parser_wrapper
.fi

Of course, one might want to put procmail filter rules into this 
to send only certain emails to the mail_parser. This should 
probably be considered a pre-filtering operation since the mail_parser(1)
itself does some subsetting of mails based on subject and sender. Note that 
to deliver a carbon copy of the email to the user, in addition to 
sending the mail off to mail_parser, one should use the procmail 'c' flag:

.nf
:0cw
|/home/rt/mail_parser_wrapper
.fi

In practice, setting up automatic mail handling may require other
cooperation from your system administrator depending on which
sendmail(1) security features are activated.

Make sure that the permissions are set appropriately
on .forward, .procmailrc, and mail_parser_wrapper to allow them to be 
invoked by system mail utilities (oftentimes a .forward file is ignored
if the permissions are not set to the satisfaction of the mail delivery
agent).
