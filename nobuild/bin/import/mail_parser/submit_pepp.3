.TH SUBMIT_PEPP 3 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
submit_pepp \- mail_parser handler for PEPP data requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
submit_pepp_handler( $message, $pfarray );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The submit_pepp handler is intended to be launched by the mail_parser(1) 
utility. The Princeton Earth Physics Project routinely sends out automated
email requests for PEPP data for significant earthquakes. Using this 
handler, the mail_parser(1) goes into a database of continuous waveform data, 
subsets out the relevant stations, chooses a waveform segment based on 
the predicted P-arrival time, extracts the waveform segment for each PEPP station
with the trexcerpt utility, and sends the resulting waveforms to a PEPP 
ftp repository via the Perl Expect module.

Handlers &Tbl{
&Arr{
# These three parameters are the main three required for the mail_parser(1)
# itself. The handler name must be "submit_pepp". The sender and subject 
# are actually regular expressions which must match the incoming PEPP
# email request for the handler to be activated. 

handler 	submit_pepp
sender 		rphinney@Princeton.EDU
subject 	PEPP Earthquake Alert

# The site database contains site-database information for the PEPP stations, 
# including an affiliation table. The waveform_db is the archive of 
# continuous waveforms. epoch2str(3)-style percent-excape characters 
# may be included in the waveform_db name. In this case, presuming the 
# archive of continuous waveforms is split up into separate volumes, the 
# origin time of the earthquake is used to construct the complete name 
# of the waveform database. 

site_db 	/Seis/databases/stations/master_stations
waveform_db 	/iwrun/op/db/archive/archive_%Y_%m_%d

# The 'net' parameter refers to a network of stations in a CSS3.0 
# affiliation table which are to be included as PEPP stations

net 		PP

# The following two parameters specify the amount of time before and 
# after the predicted P-phase arrival to include in each file

pre_P_sec	480
post_P_sec	1200

filetime 	%Y_%m_%d_%H:%M

# The following two parameters are for trexcerpt. FILETIME, if specified, 
# is replaced by a time-stamp string. This time-stamp string is constructed
# by feeding the origin-time of the earthquake into epoch2str(3) and 
# converting it to a string as specified by the filetime parameter above.

wffilename 	%{sta}_FILETIME.%{chan}.sac
wfformat	sc

# The following parameters specify the ftp repository, the correct directory, 
# the username, and the password for depositing PEPP files in the 
# central archive

ftp_repository	lasker.princeton.edu
ftp_dir		.
ftp_user	anonymous
ftp_password	johndoe@peppschool.net

# The Perl Expect module times out during dialogue with the ftp client 
# if the following number of seconds have elapsed without an expected
# response

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The submit_pepp handler assumes that the entire data sequences are 
in the archive waveform database by the time the handler is called. 
If this is not the case, data will be missed.
