Notes 11/2/95 from my questions to John Lahr about pickfiles

We don't in practice usually have pickfiles with no summary lines.
There are occasionally some teleseisms with no locations--the one
exception.

There are sometimes phase rows that have just an S phase in them, no
P phase. 

The reliable way to test whether a row has a P phase is to see whether
the P-sec field is blank. 

The "A-mag" is an average of coda mag and local mag. Possibly fair
to use it as a local mag??

The maximum amp and period in the phase line are not specific to
the P phase--they're for the station.

The C*(A) rows are for Xpick to know where the amplitude was measured--
where it's time uncertainty bars are, and where its min/max amplitude bars are.

Not all phases are defining. Those with weight greater than or equal
to 4 are non-defining.

a weight of 0 indicates the best reading. a weight of 3 indicates the
worst usable reading. 

There's a distinction between the weight and the weight-code. The former
is a characteristic of the arrival. The latter refers to its use in
a solution. 

The minimum amount of info necessary for hypoe to be able to use a 
pickfile is:
	station
	weight-code (either come up with an algorithm based on standard
		deviation, or just set it to 0)
	pick time
It needs at least three arrivals. The summary line doesn't have to be
there, but if it is then that's used as a starting location. The row
does not have to be 110 characters long if all the end fields are 
blank. P and S phases for the same station don't necessarily have to
be on the same line.
