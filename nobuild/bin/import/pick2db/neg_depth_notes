John Lahr explains that a solution with negative depth shows "-0" in 
the standard depth field, indicating that the actual, negative-depth
solution is given in a field that comes later on in the summary line.

Lahr explains that several months ago (March?) this changed. Now a 
negative depth can also show up in the first depth field. John 
guarantees that if the depth is negative it will always show up in
the extra depth field as well, an assumption on which pick2db 
relies at this point.
