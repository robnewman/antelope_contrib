.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This should really be combined with ah2db, which handles the 
official Lamont version of AH files based on XDR data representation. 
That will happen after Lamont/XDR AH is made an official Antelope 
datatype, allowing corresponding rewrite of ah2db. 

Event and calibration info are currently ignored.
