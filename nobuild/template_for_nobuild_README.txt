X has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because

it has been deprecated in favor of X.

it has been deprecated. The program may still work and may be 
of value, however the author(s) offer absolutely no promises or 
support for it. 

it was formerly in the Antelope-contrib 'junkyard' directory
and has long-since been deprecated. 

it has been adopted into the BRTT core Antelope distribution for
support and evolution under the auspices of BRTT. The historical
source-code has been left here in the Antelope-contrib repository
as a resource for people who are running older versions of Antelope, 
as a record of open-source work, and/or for those who may benefit 
from seeing the programming details. This code should not be compiled
into a modern version of Antelope lest potentially serious conflicts 
occur between the old version and the new. 

the author(s) have deemed that the source code may be of 
community interest, however for any number of reasons believe
it should not be compiled routinely into the main Antelope 
distribution (unfinished, untested, pitfalls for the uninitiated, 
parochial interest only, architectural or coding problems, 
speculative approach, etc.)
