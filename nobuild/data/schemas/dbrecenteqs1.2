	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "name of map" )
	Detail {
		This is a unique name for a map to be used for plotting 
		events. This name is distinct from the actual file name 
		containing the map image--the character string mapname 
		is used in lieu of an integer map id. For all maps that 
		are pre-generated (i.e. no earthquake etc. symbols on the map, 
		symbols added on-the fly), the mapstock table defines the 
		mapname attribute. The webmaps table then lists the current 
		version of that mapname that has specific earthquake symbols 
		on it. For maps that are generated on-the-fly, there will 
		not be an entry in the mapstock table. In these cases
		the mapname will be entirely defined by the webmaps table.

	Detail {
		The webmaps table describes where to find maps that 
		have been customized (usually with the addition of 
		particular earthquakes) and placed in directories 
		accessible to the web server. If the the map is specific 
		to a single evid, the evid field may be filled in as 
		a foreign key. If the map is specific to a single 
		hypocentral solution, the orid field may be filled in as 
		a foreign key. In most cases it will probably not make sense
		to fill in both evid and orid. For maps that contain more 
		than one event, the evid and orid fields are left blank.
