Schema dbcluster0.5
	Description ( "Centralized registry of databases" )
	Detail {
		This schema provides a centralized registry of all 
		databases available from a given filesystem (possibly 
		a composite filesystem mounted from several different 
		sources and all visible from the same root location).
		The schema supports clusters of databases with 
		regular naming conventions and divisions based (usually)
		on time intervals.
	}
	Timedate lddate
	;

Attribute clustername
	String (50)
	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "name of database cluster" )
	Detail {
		This field provides a unique nickname for each database 
		cluster, by which the database cluster will be 
		known and accessed.
	}
	;

Attribute dfile
	String (128)
	Format ( "%-128s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "data file" )
	Detail {
		This attribute is the name of a disk-based file, 
		such as the descriptor file of a database. This may 
		include percent-escape sequences which will later be 
		filled in according to an appropriate time range.
	}
	;

Attribute dir
	String (196)
	Format ( "%-196s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "directory" )
	Detail {
		This attribute is the directory-part of a path name. 
		Relative path names or '.' (dot), the notation for the 
		current directory, may be used. This may contain 
		percent-escape sequences, which will later be filled 
		in based on a time value.
	}
	;

Attribute endtime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "99999999999.000" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "epoch time of end of interval" )
	Detail {
		This field gives the end of a time range, for example
		the end of the coverage period for a database
		cluster.
	}
	;

Attribute lddate
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "time of last record modification" )
	Detail {
		This field records a Unix epoch timestamp showing the 
		last time the record was modified.
	}
	;

Attribute net
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "unique network identifier" )
	Detail {
		This character string is the name of a seismic network.
		One example is WWSSN.
	}
	;

Attribute schema
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "schema in which a database is stored" )
	Detail {
		This field gives the schema under which a database 
		is stored.
	}
	;

Attribute time
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "epoch time of start of interval" )
	Detail {
		This field gives the start of a time range, for example
		the beginning of the coverage period for a database
		cluster.
	}
	;

Attribute volumes
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "volume segmentation of clustered databases" )
	Detail {
		This field gives the boundary intervals for clustered 
		databases, for example "day", "week", "month", "year", etc. 
		The first volume is taken to start as specified by the 
		time field of the clusters relation. If a cluster of 
		databases has a non-standard start time for its volumes, 
		an individual row should be used for each database in the 
		cluster. If there is only one database referenced by 
		a particular row in the clusters table, the volumes field
		may be given as 'single'. 
	}
	;

Relation clusters
	Fields ( clustername time endtime schema volumes net dir dfile lddate )
	Primary ( clustername time::endtime )
	Alternate ( dir dfile )
	Description ( "database clusters" )
	Detail {
		This table defines clusters of databases. Each row may 
		specify one single database of a particular type 
		(indicated by clustername, for example a master_stations
		database), or a collection of databases with a regular
		naming convention. The time and endtime specify the 
		time range covered by the entire cluster (endtime may
		be left null for open-ended clusters). The specific 
		database name for each database in a cluster may be 
		derived based on percent-escape sequences in the 
		dir and dfile fields.
	}
