The Antelope python interface code has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because
it has been adopted into the BRTT core Antelope distribution for
support and evolution under the auspices of BRTT. The historical
source-code has been left here in the Antelope-contrib repository
as a resource for people who are running older versions of Antelope, 
as a record of open-source work, and/or for those who may benefit 
from seeing the programming details. This code should not be compiled
into a modern version of Antelope lest potentially serious conflicts 
occur between the old version and the new. 

IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPILE THIS OPEN-SOURCE, OLD VERSION 
OF THE ANTELOPE PYTHON INTERFACE IF YOU ARE RUNNING ANTELOPE VERSION 5.2-64 OR LATER.
FAILURE TO HEED THIS WILL NECESSITATE RE-INSTALLATION OF ANTELOPE.
