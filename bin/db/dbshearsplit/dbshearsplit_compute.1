.SH NAME
dbshearsplit_compute, dbshearsplit_display \- correct for shear-wave splitting
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP [\-v] [\-x] [\-f \fIfiltername\fP] [\-o \fIorid\fP]
[\-s \fIstation\fP] [\-d \fIdatabasename\fP] [\-i \fIinversion mode\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP computes shear-wave splitting parameters for waveforms
recorded at a given \fIstation\fP with an origin id \fIorid\fP by
minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of the 2-d covariance matrix of horizontal
particle motion. The two primary parameters of interest are the estimated
delay time, measured in seconds, and the estimated fast polarization
direction.  These values are placed in a table named \fIsplit\fP (described by 
the schema \fIssplit1.0\fP, a supplement to css3.0) for later analysis and display.

The database schema required for shear-wave splitting is called 
\fIcss3.0:ssplit1.0\fP; the ssplit1.0 add-on must be present in your antelope 
distribution's database schema directory, and should be added automatically 
by the install process.

The database which \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP is run on must have wfdisc, 
arrival, assoc, origin, and site tables present.  Running
\fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP requires modification access to the database to
create and modify entries in the split table.

Error measurements represent two sigma standard deviation.

Usage is as follows:

1) Pick time window for splitting.

This can be done with a program like dbpick.  Windows should be picked on either
the north or east component of a seismogram; the start of the window should be
indicated with an "A" phase pick and the end of the window should be indicated 
with a "F" phase pick.

2) Populate the split table with \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP.

\fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP prompts the user for origin id, station, database, 
and filter, using the defaults provided in the parameter file dbshearsplit.pf
where appropriate.

3) View the results in matlab by running dbshearsplit_display.m.

dbshearsplit_display requires two arguments (the splitid and the database name) 
and takes an optional third argument to print the results to a postscript file. 
Type \fIhelp dbshearsplit_display\fP in matlab for further details.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
.br
Provides more verbose output, including verification of inputs used.
.IP "-f \fIfiltername\fP"
.br
If you wish to apply a filter to the waveforms prior to processing, specify
the filter to use per \fBtrfilter(3)\fP. This overrides the value 
\fIfilter_string\fP from \fIdbshearsplit.pf\fP.  To explicitly set no filter
for the data, set this option to "none".
.IP "-d \fIdatabasename\fP"
.br
The database to use.  \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP requires write access to the
database to add rows to the split table. This overrides the value "dbname"
contained in \fIdbshearsplit.pf\fP
.IP "-i \fIinversion mode\fP"
.br
The type of inversion to perform. Use \fIt\fP to minimize the transverse
component or \fIe\fP to minimize the smaller eigenvalue of the covariance
matrix.
.IP "-s \fIstation\fP"
.br
The station to examine.
.IP "-o \fIorid\fP"
.br
The origin id to use.
.IP "-x"
.br
Enable database format overwriting.  \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP requires a
database in css3.0:ssplit1.0 format (though this can be modified; see
default_schema and split_schema in the parameter file section below).  If the
database requested is not in this format, \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP will fail
with an error message.  This option will cause \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP to
overwrite the database descriptor file with something appropriate.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
Default parameters for both \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP and
\fBdbshearsplit_display\fP can be stored in dbshearsplit.pf.  This file can be
stored in the default antelope pf directory for your distribution or locally
from whatever directory from which you intend to run it.

The current parameters at this time are:

.IP "logfile"
.br
The location of the log output produced by both \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP and
dbshearsplit_display for debugging purposes and is overwritten on each run.
This location will revert to /dev/null if not specified in the parameter file,
meaning that output will not be logged.
.IP "inversion_mode"
.br
The method used to compute shear-wave splitting parameters. Possible values
are t to minimize the transverse component (only appropriate for SKS phases)
or e to minimize the smaller eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of particle
motion (appropriate for SKS or other S phases).  This defaults to e.
.IP "filter_string"
.br
The default filter to apply to waveforms prior to rotation and translation. By
default, \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP will not filter waveforms and
\fBdbshearsplit_display\fP will use whatever filter is present in the database
for the specified id. For no filtering, this value should be set to a blank
string or left absent. The format of filter_string is defined per
\fBtrfilter(3)\fP.
.IP "dbname"
.br
The default database to use.
.IP "default_schema"
.br
The (optional) database format of the original database; typically
\fIcss3.0\fP.
.IP "split_schema"
.br
The (optional) database format extension to use with \fBdbshearsplit_compute\fP.
Typically \fIssplit1.0\fP.
