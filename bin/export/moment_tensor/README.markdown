# Moment Tensor Code
*Contributors: Frank Vernon (FLV), Rob Newman (RLN), Juan Reyes (JCR), Gert-Jan van den Hazel (GJV)*

### Moment tensor integration into BRTT Antelope Datascope using the Python interface to Antelope
Once installed, you run this from the command line:

```bash
dbmoment -v orid
```
where orid is an origin id in your Datascope CSS3.0 schema database

### Dependencies:
You must have the following CSS3.0 schema extensions installed

* moment_tensor_greensfuncs
* moment_tensor_images

These are located in $ANTELOPE_CONTRIB/data/schemas/css3.0.ext
where $ANTELOPE_CONTRIB is your path to the contributed code repository.

### History:

#### Fall 2010
* Initial code review and breakup of tasks. 
* GJV writes dbmoment
* JCR writes Green's functions in Python from Fortran originals
* RLN creates schema extensions to Datascope for Green's functions

#### Spring 2011
* GJV and JCR continue work in Amsterdam on their component parts

#### Summer 2011
* RLN rewrite of dbmoment
* JCR finalize Fortran translation of Green's functions into Python
* Integration of dbmoment with native Python Green's functions

#### Fall 2011
* Work on simplifying code and make as general as possible,
able to handle different Green's functions.
* Create our own local Green's functions

### Comments:
#### 2011-07-29
* dbmoment.py is not currently tethered to the moment tensor Datascope
schema extension __moment_tensor_greensfuncs__
* dbmoment.py uses 4 local files for testing: data1, data2, data3
(the three components) and green (the Greens function, aka synthetic)
* These 4 data files need to be copied to your realtime system
directly and placed in the db/data directory

#### 2011-08-01
* dbmoment.py __is now__ tethered to the moment tensor Datascope schema extensions

#### 2011-11-11
* A week of work with Matt Koes (PGC) to incorporate the PGC
pre-generated Green's functions into our code-base
* Semi-successful: the PGC is not clear on the what each of their
Green's functions blockettes represent

#### 2011-11-21
* Merge Juan's latest branch that has the generalized changes after
Matt's visit
* Work on generalizing the matrix comparisons, and make the db trexcepts
as transparent as possible

#### 2012-02-01
* Matt Koes visiting again from PGC
* Add verbose output plotting of cross-correlation values, including
plotting time-shifted data and the actual cross-correlation
* Move the Greens Function model definition to dbmoment.pf
