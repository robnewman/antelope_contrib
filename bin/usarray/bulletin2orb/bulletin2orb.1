.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Background
.LP
Association of events with externally published bulletins is a necessary
part of the analyst review process with \fBdbloc2(1)\fP or real-time event
processing using \fBdborigin2orb(1)\fP.  
Whether or not this external association happens is often 
limited by the ability of the analyst/operator to write a parser to collect these 
catalogs from other network operators via a timely automated routine.  The 
distribution format and mechanism varies from institution to institution.  
Examples of methods of distribution include:  simple http available text file, 
html augmented file available via http, XML files, ftpable file, RSS feed, 
KML mappable files, finger quake (mostly deprecated), etc.  Methods supported by
\fBbulletin2orb(1)\fP and the associated \fBbulletin.pm\fP are discussed in the
\fIBulletin Collection Types\fP section.  Formats of the web pages or retrieved 
files vary widely and are discussed in the \fISupported Bulletins\fP and 
\fIFile Formats\fP section.
.LP
Prior to the creation of \fBbulletin2orb\fP and the corresponding module
\fBbulletin.pm\fP, I had to maintain individual scripts for collection of each 
external bulletin.  Without any modules in place, each script recreated techniques
to collect the bulletin, parse information out of it, and place that information 
in the appropriate css3.0 tables.  This led to redundant code that was hard to 
maintain.  Furthermore, sharing those scripts outside of our group was problematic 
as they often had to be tweaked yearly or more often as URLs, ftp locations, or 
html styles changed.  A more reasonable approach to maintaining the scripts and 
sharing the information gleaned from them (i.e. the css3.0 origin tables) was needed.
The need for ease of maintenance led to the development of the more generic 
\fBbulletin2orb\fP script and associated \fBbulletin.pm\fP routines along with the
service of providing a single access point for external bulletin information.
.LP
The approach taken with \fBbulletin2orb\fP is to have a single data center, currently
the ANF at UCSD (Array Network Facility), maintain all of the parsing scripts in 
\fBbulletin.pm\fP.  That same data center would then run various instances 
of the \fBbulletin2orb\fP bulletin collection script.  The data center can 
then serve the data to external users via \fI/pf/$BULL/orb2dbt\fP 
packets.  The external clients collect whichever bulletins they are 
interested in by using \fBorb2orb\fP with a match statement and write individual
bulletins out to local disk via \fBorb2dbt\fP.  \fBbulletin2orb\fP is a script best used in-house
at the ANF, but has been shared with the community as a courtesy.
.LP
For information on how to collect bulletins from the orb maintained at the ANF, please
review the documentation provided with the \fIbulletins\fP \fBrtdemo(1)\fP.  You can 
adjust the provided demo such that only bulletins of interest to your specific project
are collected.  You should not have to run the \fBbulletin2orb\fP program!

.SS "General Methodology"
.LP
The procedural flow for \fBbulletin2orb\fP is that a specific \fImethod\fP is chosen that
determines how the bulletin is to be collected.  Depending upon the format of the returned 
data (i.e. single lines of text containing all information, multi-line text, downloaded
file, etc.), a \fIparser\fP and, for some bulletins, an \fIextractor\fP must also
be specified.  The bulletins to be collected by \fBbulletin2orb\fP are selected via
the \fIbulletin2orb.pf\fP.  The script runs in daemon mode (unless the \fI-1\fP option
is selected) and processes each bulletin collection routine sequentially.  The next
attempt to process all bulletins begins after the program sleeps for \fI-s\fP seconds.
For the non-searchable, non-ftp'd, rapidly supplied bulletins, checks are made 
against the previous collection run to attempt to avoid sending duplicate \fI/pf/$BULL/orb2dbt\fP 
packets into the orb.  However, you will see duplicate information sent for any bulletin
that is returned via the \fIftp\fP, \fIdbsubset\fP, or \fIsearch*\fP \fImethod\fPs.  Duplication
also occurs if the \fBbulletin2orb\fP process is restarted.  

At the ANF, multiple instances of \fBbulletin2orb\fP are running.  Update intervals 
for the various instances of \fBbulletin2orb\fP are:  10 minutes, 60 minutes, 24 hours,
and monthly.  Duplicate instances are recommended such that no undue load of excessive
data requests are put on the regional network servers.


.SS "Bulletin Collection Types - aka \fImethod\fP"
.LP
The perl module \fBbulletin.pm\fP was created to modularize the different techniques
used to collect bulletin information from external sources.  If additional methods
of collection are required (i.e. RSS feed, KML files, etc.) or new 
data formats for collected bulletin
information are discovered, new subroutines will need to be developed and added to
\fBbulletin.pm\fP.  The currently supported types of collection methods are described
below.  The method selected for a particular bulletin is specified in the \fImethod\fP 
parameter value of \fIbulletin2orb.pf\fP for each bulletin collection task.  DO NOT change
these unless you are certain you know what you are doing.  Only the methods listed below 
are currently supported.  Specifying any other \fImethod\fP in the pf file causes the 
script to die.  The actual subroutine name in \fBbulletin.pm\fP is \fBcollect_\fP\fImethod\fP.

.IP "\(bu \fBtext\fP:  plain text - web accessible"
.br

This is perhaps the simplest type to collect and process.  The text has no HTML code 
embedded in it and tends to be fixed format.  An example of published bulletins 
with this format is the CUBE format produced by the NEIC.  This bulletin can be 
collected using the \fIget\fP command of the \fILWP::Simple\fP perl module.  Each 
line can be run through a parser that checks to see if the collected line is 
new.  Each new line can then have the individual parts extracted and the info 
placed into a hash for later processing.

.IP "\(bu \fBfile\fP:  plain text file - locally accessible"
.br

This presumes you have access to an ascii file containing bulletin information.  
Perhaps the file is saved to disk from an email attachment.  The text has no HTML 
code embedded in it and tends to be fixed format.  
Each new line of the file has the individual parts extracted and the info 
placed into a hash for later processing.

.IP "\(bu \fBhtmltagged\fP or \fBhtmlnotags\fP:  HTML text - web accessible"
.br

This is the most common format.  These methods deal with information that is returned within 
some sort of frame of html code, rather than a simple text file.  

It seems that the majority of the ANSS networks 
have a web page that has a map along with basic lat/lon/depth/mag information and
a link to another html page with more detailed information (the embedded html
link necessitates the use of the \fIhtmltagged\fP method).  Unfortunately, there 
is a wide variety in format within these lists: a) Do they use +/- 
with the lat/lon, use N/S and E/W indicators, or assume you know they are only reporting 
longitude West? b) Are there any extra characters after depth or magnitude? 
c) Is the magnitude type defined as ml, md, mc, M, or unknown? d) Do they 
use UTC or local time (and are their computers modern enough 
to deal with the new dates that Standard and Daylight time changes occur)?  
Examples of published bulletins collected by this method are:  
NEIC QED, UUSS-combo, PNSN, Lamont, and CERI(NMSN).  These bulletins require the \fIread_url\fP 
subroutine which uses the \fInew\fP and \fIrequest\fP commands of the 
\fILWP::UserAgent\fP Perl module along with the 
\fIHTML::Parser new\fP Perl module for the \fIparse\fP and \fIdecode_entities\fP 
routines.  The returned array contains 
dissimilar lines, so the \fIcollect_htmltagged\fP or \fIcollect_htmlnotags\fP  
subroutine reviews each line making sure all 
pieces of information are available before adding it to an array for review via 
a parser subroutine. 

There are other institutions that use slightly different 
formats that have no embedded html links (i.e. MTECH(reviewed and auto), 
UNR-NBE, daily UUSS and YELL, and NRCAN) that use the \fIcollect_htmlnotags\fP 
method which then calls the \fIget\fP command.  
In this case, a temporary file is collected and saved to \fI/tmp/notags_$parser\fP.  
See the PARAMETER FILE section for definition of \fIparser\fP.  An intermediary subroutine extracts 
the usable lines (basically those lines between the <pre></pre> tags), converts/fixes 
the different time and lat/lon values, and creates a usable array of lines that 
are put into the %parsed_info and %magnitude_info hashes via the \fIparse\fP subroutines.

.IP "\(bu \fBsearch_post\fP or \fBsearch_qf\fP:  HTML or plain text - via web search"
.br

There are two types of search requests that can be made using the Perl module \fILWP::UserAgent\fP 
and \fIquery_form\fP (i.e. SCEC/SCSN) or \fIPOST\fP (NRCAN(search), NCSN, NBE(search), NESN(search).  
Both return information that is saved to a file name \fI/tmp/search_$parser\fP
and then extracted via an "extract" subroutine.  Again, the output format varies widely.
There are some bulletin search 
routines (i.e. CERI/NMSN) which require an intermediate step where the user has to 
click a button to move on to the final results.  I have skipped any attempt to try 
to program for this.  Although not proven, I suspect that the searchable results 
are updated less frequently than the plain or HTML text that is web accessible.  I also
expect that the search function may take more resources than a simply served HTML file, 
thus it is recommended that bulletin collections of this type be run at much less 
frequent intervals.  In particular, you may not want to run \fBbulletin2orb\fP in
the default daemon mode, but instead use the \fI-1\fP option for single execution
and collect this type of bulletin via cronjob.  The maximum number of events that 
you can have returned from a search is 20,000.  If you request a longer time window, 
that may have more than 20,0000 events, the event list will be truncated at 20,0000.  

.IP "\(bu \fBftp\fP:  plain text via ftp"
.br

Historically, reviewed bulletins have been distributed in a well-defined fixed format 
file via ftp.  Documentation for the format is normally available and the format
changes very infrequently.  However, these bulletins tend to be bundled and cover
a long period of data.  Furthermore, bulletins available via ftp tend to not be 
updated as frequently as formats available via http.  Thus, these bulletin types
may be more useful to analysts using \fBdbloc2(1)\fP doing delayed event reviews
than for a real-time system using \fBdborigin2orb(1)\fP.  You may not want to run 
\fBbulletin2orb\fP in the default daemon mode, but instead use the \fI-1\fP option 
for single execution and collect this type of bulletin via cronjob.  
Collection of information from the ftp bulletins involves connecting to the remote
site, checking to see if the remote file was updated more recently than the 
last update time of the file stored on the local disk, and downloading all available 
remote files that have been updated. The storage location is specified in \fIbulletin2orb.pf\fP.
After file retrieval, the retrieved bulletin is opened, parsed, and event information is extracted.

.IP "\(bu \fBdbsubset\fP: local database subset"
.br

As a data center, you may also produce your own css3.0 origin and netmag tables.  The
\fIdbsubset\fP method allows you to collect your bulletin information and distribute it
to others via \fBbulletin2orb\fP.  Currently, subsetting options are limited to time and
author:  no lat/lon or magnitude subsets are available.  Only origin and netmag information 
is collected and redistributed.  Each origin row that matches the \fIauth_subset\fP from the
pf is added to the export \fIorb\fP.  NOTE:  if you have multiple orids for a single event
they will be pushed to the export \fIorb\fP as single events!  The database the client 
writes out is not identical to the input database, \fIdb\fP as all prefor information 
is lost. 

.SS "Supported Bulletins"
.LP 
Many institutions have 
multiple methods for collection (i.e. a web page with rapid solutions, 
a searchable bulletin, and/or a downloadable ftp file).  You may or may not want to collect
all types of bulletins from a regional network.  My goal was to produce
parsers and collect information from a wide variety of bulletins in a method that was sustainable
and able to expand as new bulletins are discovered.  The end-user can pick and choose the best
solution from the origin table generated by \fBorb2dbt(1)\fP.
 
The table below shows the responsible institution or network, whether or not 
non-reviewed events may be included (if known), how frequently the bulletin is updated by the 
responsible data center, and the \fImethod\fP, \fIparser\fP, and \fIextractor\fP.

Some bulletins are updated rapidly, within a few minutes to hours of the event 
origin time.  Bulletins of this type which can be collected via \fBbulletin2orb\fP 
include:  NEIC-CUBE, NEIC-QED, EMSC, UUSS (combo and daily, YELL-daily, Lamont-LCSN, 
CERI-NMSN, PNSN, NRCAN (PGC and GSC), MTECH (automatic and reviewed), and UNR-NBE.
These rapid updating bulletin types can be requested fairly often without putting 
a high processing load on either the remote distributor or the host running
\fBbulletin2orb\fP.

Some bulletins are updated every few hours or daily, 
include less frequently updated reviewed solutions, or require submissions to a 
search page.  These bulletins should not have a collection attempt made every 600 
seconds.  Instead you should run a separate instance of \fBbulletin2orb\fP which
overrides the default sleep window with a larger value for \fI-s\fP, or run a multiple
time per day (or week) cron job.  Bulletins that you might wish to attempt to
collect multiple times per day include:  ANF, BC-NESN, NBE-search, NCSN-search, 
and SCSN-search.  Bulletins that you might wish to collect daily include:  
AEIC, NEIC-QEDweekly and GSmines.  Bulletins that you might wish to attempt to collect a
few times per month include:  NEIC-PDE, PNSN-rev, UUSS-lists, and YELL-lists.  You
might also consider recollecting many of the searchable bulletins once a month with 
a longer time window supplied to the search.  In this way you might attempt to catch
events that have been reprocessed or added after analyst review of back-logged data.

NOTE:  There will be duplicate origin data written to the export orb for many of these
bulletins.  This is especially true for any of the searchable bulletins as each successive
search returns the same data.  Attempts have been made to limit the duplication of
event data for those bulletins that have a rapid update interval and are not results
from a search.  I expect that the endusers' \fBorb2dbt(1)\fP process will deal with 
any duplication of data.


.SS "Supported File Formats"

There are a multitude of different file formats that have been developed by individual
institutions.  Some are more consistent and better documented than others.

.IP "\(bu \fBrecenteqs\fP"
.LP
Many of the regional networks provide a web page that has a map along with a
list of earthquakes.  There is no formal format description that I have found.  In general,
the listings seem to have a magnitude (no magtype), a date, lat, lon, depth, and location.
The majority of the ANSS networks include links in their earthquake lists. 
Those that have these embedded links use the \fIhtmltagged\fP \fImethod\fP with the 
\fIrecenteqs\fP \fIparser\fP and the \fIqedWWW\fP or \fIneicWWW\fP \fIextractor\fP.  
This type of bulletin collection needs to have the time zone \fITZ\fP, 
\fIextractor\fP, and \fIdefaultmagtype\fP specified in the parameter file.  

Some regional networks provide a web page map and listing which has no html links.  
These bulletins use the
\fIhtmlnotags\fP \fImethod\fP and either \fIrecenteqs\fP or an institution specific
\fIparser\fP (i.e. mtechAUTO, NBEwww, uussLIST).  An \fIextractor\fP
needs to be specified and varies depending on the institution which produces the bulletin.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -1
Execute the program only once.  This option allows you to attempt a single collection 
of each bulletin defined in the pf \fIbulletins\fP section instead of the normal daemon
mode which attempts to collect indefinitely every \fI-s\fP seconds. 
.IP "-p pf"
Parameter file to use.  The default \fIpf\fP is \fIbulletin2orb.pf\fP.
.IP "-s seconds"
Interval to pause between collection attempts.  The default value is 600 seconds which
works well for the rapidly updating bulletins.  It is strongly recommended to increase
this value if you are attempting to collect bulletins that are not updated frequently 
or require a search on the far side.  
.IP -v 
Verbose elog output.
.IP -V 
More verbosity than you should ever need.  Used for debugging purposes only.  Should not
be used for an operational \fBbulletin2orb\fP.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Must have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh or $ANTELOPE.sh.  Your version of Antelope 
needs to be 4.11 (fully patched) or higher.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fIbulletin2orb.pf\fP parameter file contains a series of \fBbulletins\fP
(in an associative array).  The \fBbulletins\fP array has one or more bulletin
specifications.  Each bulletin specification consists of an associative array
with the bulletin name (user specified) as the associative array key.  Bulletin
parameters can vary depending on the \fImethod\fP and/or the \fIparser\fP.  Changes
to the \fImethod\fP, \fIparser\fP, \fIextractor\fP, \fIurl\fP, \fIftphost\fP, 
\fIftpdir\fP, \fIftpmatch\fP, or \fIlinestart\fP are NOT RECOMMENDED! 
.LP
In general, only change the \fIsrc\fP, \fIlocaldir\fP, and \fIndays\fP.  Leave the 
remainder as is or unexpected results may occur.

Searchable bulletins and those using the \fIdbsubset\fP method need to have an \fIndays\fP
parameter to define the time range of the search.
.LP
Searchable bulletins and those using the \fIdbsubset\fP method can have an \fIenddate\fP
parameter to define the ending time for the search.  If not specified, search looks for \fIndays\fP
of data prior to \fBnow()\fP. 
.LP
Whether or not a particular bulletin needs an \fIextractor\fP specified depends on the
format and \fImethod\fP used to collect it.  Don't change the defaults.
.LP
Bulletins using the \fIftp\fP method need to have an \fIftphost\fP, \fIftpdir\fP, 
\fIftpmatch\fP, \fIlinestart\fP, \fIaccount\fP, and \fIlocaldir\fP specified.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
See \fBrtdemo(1)\fP \fIbulletins\fP for methodology for collecting the 
bulletins from the server provided by the ANF.
.LP
For earthquake bulletins that are updated rapidly and require no search of
remote site:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB bulletin2orb -p pf/bulletin2orb_rapid $ORB \fP

.fi
.ft R
.in
.LP
  For earthquake bulletins that are updated frequently but may require searchs or
other retreival mechanisms that are CPU intensive (on the remote side).  Collect 
only once an hour.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB bulletin2orb -s 3600 -p pf/bulletin2orb_multi $ORB \fP

.fi
.ft R
.in
.LP
For earthquake bulletins that are updated once less frequently, maybe once or twice
a day, but contain multiple months of data, or otherwise don't need to be collected
raidly, collect once per day: 
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB bulletin2orb -s 86400 -p pf/bulletin2orb_daily $ORB \fP

.fi
.ft R
.in
.LP
  For earthquake bulletins that are updated infrequently, maybe once or twice
a month, or for re-collecting long stretches of data from searchable bulletins, 
collect via a cron job run monthly.  Use the non-daemon mode of operations. 
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB bulletin2orb -1 -p pf/bulletin2orb_monthly $ORB \fP

.fi
.ft R
.in

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
If you select a \fImethod\fP, \fIparser\fP, or \fIextractor\fP that is not defined in
\fBbulletin.pm\fP the script fails in unexpected ways.
.LP
Error messages like:  

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
Use of uninitialized value $p in hash dereference at bin/bulletin2orb line 120.
Use of uninitialized value $m in hash dereference at bin/bulletin2orb line 121.
Use of uninitialized value $parsed_info{"or_time"} in string at bin/bulletin2orb line 349.

imply that critical information is not being retrieved from the bulletin
collected via the \fIftp\fP method.  It is highly likely that the input 
you are trying to read is a \fIshort\fP line placed by the originating 
institution to signify a comment, a non-located event, or a deleted 
event (\fBbulletin2orb\fP has no provisions to deal with deleted events).  
You can review the retrieved file to see what might be going on.  
To avoid the \fIshort\fP lines in the input file, specify a 
\fIlinelength\fP parameter in the appropriate bulletin collection 
task section of the parameter file.  Lines shorter than \fIlinelength\fP 
are rejected.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The most important caveat:  Garbage In = Garbage Out.
.LP
I am still finding new and interesting ways to cause this program to fail.  
Consider this an early beta release...  I suspect that there may be 
memory issues when this program is run for a long time.  No long-term 
testing has been completed yet.
.LP
The client must use Antelope version 4.11 (fully patched). 
Previous versions of \fBorb2dbt(1)\fP do not write out origin rows 
for non-associating events.
.LP 
There is no subsetting of the data collected from the remote sites.  For 
instance, if you are only interested in teleseismic events but are 
collecting the NEIC-CUBE bulletin, there is no way to subset the incoming
list of events:  this program returns all events that are reported, including the 
local ones.
.LP
If you are collecting many bulletins, or are running the script for the
first time and have to collect many of the \fIftp\fP files, it can take
significantly longer than the default 600 seconds between bulletin 
collection passes.  
.LP
The \fIdbsubset\fP method is less than ideal as it does not perform an
exact duplication of data that was in the input \fIdb\fP. Other methods
have been put in to contrib to help with complete database replication.
.LP
Although this is a vast improvement over previous procedures to collect
external bulletins, it is still a very complex procedure.  Further attempts
at documentation would probably be a good idea.  I expect to present 
something about this at a future Antelope User Group Meeting so a presentation
will be available at some point.
.LP
After years of trying to collect random formats of bulletin data produced by
multiple sources and finally making the "one script to rule them all", I am 
reminded of a phrase that my daughter learned in
kindergarten:  "You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit."  It seems
appropriate for both the author and endusers to keep in mind.  
.LP
If you have a favorite bulletin that does not currently have a method for
collection or parsing, feel free to contact me to see if I would consider 
writing a parser for it.  However see previous caveat...
