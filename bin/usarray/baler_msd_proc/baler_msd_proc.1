.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the third in a series of 5 programs for processing baler 44 miniseed data.  The programs are
\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP, \fBrsync_baler\fP, \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP, \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP, and \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.

\fBbaler_msd_proc\fP is designed to take raw miniseed data and reorganize the miniseed blocketts
into station-channel-day files for BH and LH seismic data and BD and LD infrasound/pressure data. All other SOH (state-of-health) 
channels as well as VH and UH seismic data are written into station-channel-month files.  
In either case, the content of the original miniseed blocketts is unaltered, with two exceptions, 
.IP 
1) a misnamed channel-loc_code pair can be fixed through the parameter file
.IP 
2) a misnamed sta code can be fixed through the parameter file
.LP
\fBbaler_msd_proc\fP can be operated in two modes.  In normal usage top command line is used.  In this 
mode the program opens the \fIdb\fP \fIdeployment\fP table to determine which stations need to be processed.
To process multiple stations simultaneously on multi-processor machines, \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP will fork 
itself for each station using the second command line.  This is done because the Mac OSX requires a forked
process to be exec'ed internally to work properly.  This construction also works on other Unix platforms.
\fBThe second command line is only used in debugging\fP.

\fBbaler_msd_proc\fP will limit itself to use only half the cores available up to 20 total with a minimum of 1. 

\fBbaler_msd_proc\fP creates an output directory \fIarchivebase/sta\fP.  In this directory miniseed 
files are written as follows:
.IP 
1) [BL][HD] station-channel-day files are written in YYYY/DDD directories
.IP 
2) all other station-channels are written into YYYY/month_files/MM directories
.LP

The assumptions of the program are that:
.IP 
the station baler 14 data (if it exists) for station \fIsta\fP are kept in a directory \fIbaler14dirbase/sta\fP
.IP 
the station baler 14 data (if it exists) for station \fIsta\fP are completely downloaded 
and no more baler 14 data will be downloaded in the future.
.IP 
the station baler 44 data for station \fIsta\fP are kept in a directory \fIbaler44dirbase/sta\fP
.IP 
the original BH and LH data are kept in a subdirectory \fIbhdata_dir\fP
.IP 
the original VH, UH, and SOH data are kept in a subdirectory \fIsohdata_dir\fP
.IP 
baler 14 miniseed file names follow the regular expression "C.*\.bms.*"
.IP 
baler 44 miniseed file names are listed in the db table \fIbaler44dirbase/sta/sta.rsyncbaler\fP
.LP

Baler 14 data will be moved to the directory \fIbaler14procbase/sta\fP and not processed again.

Baler 44 data will have the appropriate row in the db table \fIbaler44dirbase/sta/sta.rsyncbaler\fP
updated by setting the \fImsdtime\fP field to the time when the file was converted.  Only files with  
the field \fIstatus\fP of "downloaded" and \fImsdtime\fP set to NULL will be processed. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not execute commands.
.IP -c
Only checks data downloads for baler 44.  Does not process.
.IP -d
Skip md5 checks for miniseed files
.IP -F
Force processing by ignoring all gap problems and processing the files which miniseed files actually exist.
.IP -B
Ignoring gap problems immediately following installation and process.
.IP -E
Ignoring gap problems immediately prior to removal and process.
.IP -G
Ignoring gap problems not associated with the installation or removal process.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP.
.IP "-m mail_to"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space.
.IP "-f nforks"
Limit the number of forked processes.
.IP "-s sta_regex"
Regular expression of stations to process.
