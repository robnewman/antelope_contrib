.TH DBASSOCIATE 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
dbassociate \- takes arrival db and an external catalog and tries to associate all unassociated arrival
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbassociate \fP  [-v] [-n] [-e] [-i] \fIarrival_db\fP] \fIcatalog_db\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program takes \fIarrival_db.arrival\fP  table, does a dbnojoin with the assoc table, and tests
to see if any of the no-joined arrivals match to \fIarrival_db.origin\fP.  
All new associations are  incorportated into \fIarrival_db\fP. Then \fIarrival_db\fP is closed.

In the second step, the \fIarrival_db.arrival\fP table is reopened, and again does a dbnojoin with the assoc table.
This time the no-joined arrives match to \fIcatalog_db.origin\fP.  \fIcatalog_db.origin\fP is subsetted 
to provide only the last lddate for near duplicate origins by calling \fBlast_origin_lddate(1)\fP.
All new associations, origins, netmags, are  incorportated into \fIarrival_db\fP. Then \fIarrival_db\fP is closed.

This programs calls \fBdbloc_assoc(1)\fP to generate the assoc, origin, netmag and proper phase entries in assoc.

\fBdbassociate\fP has a similar function to the older \fBdbassoc_arrival(1)\fP.  Differences are that
\fBdbassociate\fP compares both internal and external origin tables, handles netmag entries properly,
and using dbloc_assoc to generate proper phase from the travel time calculator instead of just copying
iphase from the arrival table into phase in the assoc table.

Associations are defined by P waves having ( abs( $timeres ) < 3.0 ) and S waves having ( abs( $timeres ) < 10.0 ).

This program is designed to be used during the verification stage of an analyst review.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -n
No operation.  Examine dbs and get counts.  \fIarrival_db\fP not updated.
.IP -e
Only compare no-joined arrivals to \fIcatalog_db.origin\fP
.IP -i
Only compare no-joined arrivals to \fIarrival_db.origin\fP]

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  

.SH RETURN VALUES
0 if successful, 1 if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
dbassoc_arrival(1)
dbloc_assoc(1)
last_origin_lddate(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If using the -n option then the count of the unassociated arrivals will be the same for both
origin tables, since 
the real associations to the \fIarrival_db.origin\fP did not occur.
