.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrsync_baler2json\fP will read a local directory that archives rsync_baler
       folders for Baler44 stations and will output the status of the tables
       in JSON format. This is the fastest way of creating a website that will
       present this information to the users.  Maybe not to use in realtime to
       export data to http calls but to update json file for the ajax calls
       from the clients.  The script is simple and may fail if used outside
       ANF-TA installation.
