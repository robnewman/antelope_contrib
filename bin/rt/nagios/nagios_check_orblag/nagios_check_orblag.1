.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_orblag\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to the
Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be
installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory)
and called through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin queries
the specified orbserver orb for it's clients relative read position
(lag) in the orb.
The value will then be compared to the warning and critical thresholds.
Used in combination with APAN or another tool, this plugin could be
used for performance measurements and/or graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

The -m and -r options work to specify which clients (as shown in
\fBorbstat -c\fP) should be considered when calculating the lag value.
If the -o argument is not supplied, ":" is used by default.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
\- start > end>
\- start and ":" is not required if start=0
\- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
\- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
\- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
\- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This assumes that $ANTELOPE and other Antelope environment variables
have been set properly. This can be done in the startup script
for the Nagios system.
