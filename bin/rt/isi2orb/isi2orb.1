.SH NAME
isi2orb \- Acquire data from the IDA Systems Interface into an orbserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
isi2orb [-vV] [-p pfname] [-S statefile] server orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBisi2orb\fP acquires continuous waveform data from one or more stations
in the International Deployment of Accelerometers (IDA), via the IDA 
Systems Interface (ISI). An Antelope parameter-file controls the streams to be 
imported; wildcards are supported. 

The \fIserver\fP argument on the command line must specify the IDA 
server compliant with the implemented version of the IDA Systems Interface
(ISI) toolkit. The \fIorbname\fP parameter gives the name of an 
Antelope orbserver to which continuous data should be written. 

Further detail on the parameter file contents, which identify the 
continuous waveform data streams to import, is given in the PARAMETER 
FILE section of the man page below. An alternate parameter-file may be 
given via the -p option on the command line.

The \fIcalib\fP and \fIcalper\fP values for the stations being acquired
are derived from an ISI configuration report requested from the server 
at startup. If the stations being acquired are not present in that
configuration report (a situation which will hopefully not occur), 
the \fIcalib\fP and \fIcalper\fP values are set to null defaults of 
0.0 and -1.0, respectively. 

An optional \fIstatefile\fP can maintain a record of the latest 
data acquired for each station channel, resetting the data request as 
necessary after restarts. This is a sophisticated feature, however, 
and comes with some caveats (see the PARAMETER FILE and BUGS AND 
CAVEATS sections below).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pfname" 
Specify a parameter file other than the default \fIisi2orb.pf\fP.
.IP "-S statefile" 
Specify a state file to use for reconnecting seamlessly without loss 
of data. Without this parameter, \fBisi2orb\fP always starts from the 
newest available data. With it, \fBisi2orb\fP attempts to reconnect to 
the server and rewind to the last saved data for each stream. 
.IP -v 
Verbose
.IP -V
Very Verbose
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP net
This is the SEED network code, usually \fIII\fP, to use for the orb 
source-names for the packets. 
.IP streams
This parameter holds a table of ISI-style stream expressions. These are of
the form \fIsta.chn.loc\fP where one or more of those may optionally be 
an asterisk character, indicating a wildcard. (The legacy mode of placing
many such triplets together separated by plus-signs (\fI+\fP) is supported
as well, though not encouraged due to the potential to make a hard-to-read
parameter file). 
.IP uppercase
This parameter specifies whether to convert station, channel, and loc
codes to uppercase before creating the orbserver source-names. 
.IP segtype
This parameter specifies the segtype value to use in orb waveform packets 
for the converted data. 
.IP isi_logging
This parameter sets the logging mode of the ISI libraries. If set to 
\fIstdout\fP or \fIstderr\fP, the respective Unix output stream will be 
used. If set to \fIelog\fP, logging will be redirected to the Antelope 
elog(3) facility. Note that this redirection only happens when 
\fBisi2orb\fP is in verbose mode. 
.IP isi_debug
This parameter sets the integer debug level of the ISI libraries. The default, 
for no debugging output, is 0. If set to 1, some debug information is 
emitted. For further information, consult the ISI Toolkit documentation. 
Note that this setting is entirely independent of the \fBisi2orb\fP logging
behaviors controlled by the \fI-v\fP and \fI-V\fP options. 
.IP iacp_timeout_msec
This integer parameter sets the timeout allowance for the IDA Authenticated Communication
Protocol (IACP), which currently defaults to 30,000 milliseconds. \fBisi2orb\fP
will not allow this timeout to be configured below the minimum for the 
IACP protocol, also currently 30,000 milliseconds. 
.IP statefile_rewind_max_sec 
This parameter specifies the maximum length of time \fBisi2orb\fP 
will rewind dataflow based on state-file information. If this is exceeded, 
dataflow is reset to the newest values in the server. 
.IP port 
If this parameter is nonzero, a port other than the default is used
to connect to the server. 
.IP too_old
Some positive time difference between now and the packet time may be specified,
in which case packets older than now() - too_old are ignored and not 
put on the orb. The time can be in seconds or anything understood by 
str2epoch(3), for example "72:00" for 72 hours. 
.IP too_new
Some positive time difference between now and the packet time may be specified,
in which case packets newer than now() + too_new are ignored and not 
put on the orb. The time can be in seconds or anything understood by 
str2epoch(3), for example "72:00" for 72 hours.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
In verbose mode, \fBisi2orb\fP announces the program start time, announces the 
actual data request string sent
to the server, then announces every station-channel as it is first seen in the 
incoming data stream. In very verbose mode, \fBisi2orb\fP will also 
emit the configuration report requested from the server on startup, the 
fully detailed data request, and summary metadata for each acquired packet.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The \fIisi_logging\fP parameter affects only the disposition of notification 
messages from within the ISI toolkit library (libisi(3)) itself, 
not the logging from the main \fBisi2orb\fP program (which always goes through
the Antelope logging mechanism) or the output of the initial reports 
in veryverbose (-V) mode (which always go to Unix standard-out).

If the \fIstreams\fP table contains wildcards, upon reconnection the 
\fBisi2orb\fP module will rewind the wildcarded streams to the oldest 
channel matching the wildcard expression that is found in the state file. 
This may or may not be what you want. Furthermore, this can result 
in the re-acquisition of some packets which may have been already 
acquired, if not all the streams matching the wildcard ended at the 
same time. While re-acquired packets will not be placed on the orb if they
are older than the statefile entry for that station-channel, this can 
result in some wasted bandwidth. Due to the potential for large unintended
downloads it may be best not to use the statefile tracking feature
with wildcard expressions that ensnare many stations, or significant 
delays may occur. Alternatively, the \fIstatefile_rewind_max_sec\fP parameter
may be set to a nonzero value to prevent data requests larger than
a certain size for wildcarded expressions. If you experience problems, it may
be better not to use wildcarded expressions in conjunction with state files. 

The \fIstreams\fP table expressions are case-sensitive! At the time of this writing, 
the IDA servers tabulate station and channel names in lowercase letters. Thus, 
until such time as the server policy changes, the streams-table entries need to be lowercase. 
The parameter \fIuppercase\fP in the \fIisi2orb.pf\fP parameter-file has nothing to do with 
the alphabetic case of letters in expressions sent to the IDA server; rather, this parameter 
specifies whether to force the letters used in orb source-names to be uppercase. 

The individual station-channel streams are emitted as streams of orbserver 
GENC packets. In principle they could be multiplexed into MGENC packets 
on a per-station basis.

\fBisi2orb\fP will not function correctly if there is a firewall blocking
access to the IDA server. For example, if you are trying to import data 
from idahub.ucsd.edu on the default port (currently 39136), the machine 
from which you are running \fBisi2orb\fP must have access through any 
existing firewalls to that port over TCP.
